  "body": "ElementsAccessor::IncludesValueImpl and Fast* IncludesValueImpl overrides in objects/elements.cc implement the core C++ fast-paths for includes/indexOf logic across ElementsKinds. Key points:\n- ElementsKind dispatch and hole semantics handled per accessor (FastSmiOrObject, FastDouble, Dictionary, TypedElementsAccessor).\n- SameValueZero semantics implemented: NaN handling for double/object kinds; holes treated as undefined for includes (see comments and hole checks in Fast*IncludesValueImpl).\n- Prototype no-elements checks: many fast paths assume JSObject::PrototypeHasNoElements; DictionaryElementsAccessor fast path requires PrototypeHasNoElements and checks for accessors.\n- IncludesValueFastPath exists for DictionaryElementsAccessor to avoid slow path when no accessors.\n- TypedElementsAccessor::IncludesValueImpl handles detach/out-of-bounds (WasDetached/IsDetached checks), BigInt vs Number handling and lossless conversion for BigInt typed arrays, and RAB/GSAB out-of-bounds semantics.\n",
