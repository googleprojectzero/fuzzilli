  "body": "builtins/builtins-array-gen.cc: ArrayIncludesIndexofAssembler::Generate and GenerateSmiOrObject/GeneratePackedDoubles/GenerateHoleyDoubles implement Array.prototype.includes fast-paths using elements kind checks, fromIndex logic, SameValueZero handling (NaN==NaN), treating holes as undefined; includes builtins: ArrayIncludes, ArrayIncludesSmi, ArrayIncludesSmiOrObject, ArrayIncludesPackedDoubles, ArrayIncludesHoleyDoubles.\n\nbuiltins/typed-array.tq: TypedArray helpers: LoadFixedTypedArrayElementAsTagged, LoadJSTypedArrayLengthAndCheckDetached, EnsureAttached, TypedArrayAccessor, checks for detached/out-of-bounds, typed-array length and data ptr loading, element-kind specific accessors and StoreJSAny/StoreNumeric returning kStoreFailureArrayDetachedOrOutOfBounds.\n\ncompiler/js-call-reducer.cc: JSCallReducer::ReduceArrayIncludes handles reducing Array.prototype.includes into builtin calls: ReduceArrayIncludes (searches for Builtin::kArrayIncludes*), inserting map/element-kind checks, depends on NoElementsProtector, ArrayBufferDetachingProtector for typed arrays; emits deopt reasons like DeoptimizeReason::kArrayBufferWasDetached, kNotASmi, kWrongCallTarget, kNotAHeapNumber etc. Also includes TF graph building: uses simplified ops like LoadElement/LoadTypedElement, CheckIf, CheckBounds, MapGuard, ConvertTaggedHoleToUndefined, etc.\n\nsrc/ic: (to be discovered) LoadIC/KeyedLoadIC/CallIC handlers used for element access feedback and builtins inlining; feedback influences ReduceArrayIncludes.\n\nsrc/objects/elements.* and src/objects/js-array.*: elements kinds checks (IsHoleyElementsKind, IsFastPackedElements), handling of holes as TheHole, ConvertTaggedHoleToUndefined used in reductions, SameValueZero logic for NaN handling via Float64IsNaN branching in builtin code.\n\nExplanation: These entries capture the main code locations and the concrete checks: receiver is FastJSArray (BranchIfFastJSArrayForRead), elements kind switch (LoadElementsKind -> branches for SMI/SMI_OR_OBJECT/PACKED_DOUBLE/HOLEY_DOUBLE/ANY), fromIndex Smi/undefined check, bounds checks (start >= length), holes treated as undefined, SameValueZero implemented by comparing NaN specially in numeric paths, typed arrays validated via LoadJSTypedArrayLengthAndCheckDetached, and deopts/protector dependencies managed in ReduceArrayIncludes.
