CSA (AccessorAssembler) recognizes this handler and emits a guarded sequence that checks receiver, canonicalizes key, bounds-checks, switches on string representation, and returns a one-char string. Optimized compilers (TurboFan/Maglev) consume feedback and attach a dependency on Protectors::string_wrapper_to_primitive_protector so String wrappers can be treated like primitives; protector invalidation triggers deopts and IC reconfiguration.\n\nWhy this matters:\n- This fast-path provides a highly-optimized common-case for s[i] on strings, but correctness depends on prototype chain invariants guarded by the protector. Understanding the files and symbols (ic.cc, handler-configuration, accessor-assembler, builtins-ic-gen, protectors.*, compilation-dependencies) is essential to modify/validate this behavior.\n",
