The builder emits AddNewNode<Float64ToHeapNumberForField>({value}) to allocate a new HeapNumber for the field.\n\nProperties:\n- InputTypes: HoleyFloat64\n- OpProperties: NotIdempotent, CanAllocate, DeferredCall (conversion node that forces allocation)\n- GenerateCode and SetValueLocationConstraints implemented in maglev-ir.cc (GenerateCode will allocate a HeapNumber and return its reference; used specifically for field transitions where a new mutable HeapNumber is needed)\n\nWhere it's interesting: This node implements \"AllocateMutableHeapNumber\" semantics when storing a double into a field whose representation requires a boxed HeapNumber (transition). It is distinct from Float64ToTagged (which can canonicalize to Smi or HeapNumber) since it forces allocation for field ownership.\n\nFileLine: maglev/maglev-ir.h:4371-4378, maglev/maglev-ir.cc:5282-5294\n",

  "explanation": "Float64ToHeapNumberForField is the IR allocation node for creating a mutable HeapNumber specifically to own a field's double value. The graph builder adds it whenever a double store requires a transition_map allocation; otherwise Maglev uses StoreFloat64 to update an existing HeapNumber.value_ in-place.",
