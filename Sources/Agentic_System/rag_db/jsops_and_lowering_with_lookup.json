  "explanation": "This entry clarifies the JS operator layer and generic lowering behavior for with-scope creation and lookup slot operations. It identifies that CreateWithContext is a first-class JS op that gets lowered to Runtime::PushWithContext. Lookup slot operations do not have dedicated JS ops and are represented as JSCallRuntime to specific Runtime:: functions. ToObject is a generic operator and lowered via builtin. It also references context load/store ops used for fast paths and eliminated later.",
