WasmJSFunctionData::offheap_data()->set_compiled_wrapper installs compiled import wrapper in CPT for internal.\n- WasmInternalFunction: Holds call_target (raw CPT index) and implicit_arg (WasmDispatchTable or WasmImportData). Provides try_get_external to retrieve external JSFunction and GetOrCreateExternal to lazily build JS external.\n- WasmImportData: Holds native_context, callable, sig, suspend flag, and table_slot/origin for imported function; used by wrappers to obtain callable and context.\n- WasmDispatchTable/WasmDispatchTableData: Dispatch table used for imported functions; provides InstallCompiledWrapper(table_slot, WasmCode*), WrapperCodePointerForDebugging, sig(table_slot); used in tier-up to install compiled wrapper.\n- ImportedFunctionEntry: not directly used by wrappers but part of instance import machinery.\n- UseGenericWasmToJSWrapper: flag at function or instance level to force generic wrapper usage (not found directly; conceptually present in older code)\n- WasmTrustedInstanceData: Provides access to module, native_context, well-known imports, memory/tables, and arrays used by wrappers and runtimes.\n- WasmContinuationObject / WasmSuspenderObject: Objects used by async stack switching; fields: Resume/Reject closures; used by BuildSuspend.\n- WasmCodePointerTable: used by wrappers to map RawCallTarget to absolute entry pointer.\nNotes:\n- The file contains TQ-generated structs and tagged fields offsets that wrappers read via LoadProtectedPointerField/LoadTrustedPointerField and store operations reflected in wrappers.cc and TF builder.\n- Many JS-visible interactions in runtime-wasm.cc rely on these objects\u2019 methods for tier-up, dispatch install, table ops, and lazy tag resolution.\n",

This is crucial for understanding how wrappers locate call targets, implicit args, and where compiled wrappers are installed during tier-up.",
