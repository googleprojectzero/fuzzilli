This emits either StoreTaggedFieldNoWriteBarrier or StoreTaggedFieldWithWriteBarrier depending on CanElideWriteBarrier. It also handles escaping/virtual object initialization and delegates to TryBuildStoreTaggedFieldToAllocation when appropriate. Used in TryBuildStoreField for field stores and in other contexts (context cell stores, property cell stores, etc.).\n",
