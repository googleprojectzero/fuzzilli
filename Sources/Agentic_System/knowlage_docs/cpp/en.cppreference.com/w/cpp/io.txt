Contents 1 Stream-based I/O 1.1 Abstraction 1.2 File I/O implementation 1.3 String I/O implementation 1.4 Array I/O implementations 1.5 Synchronized output (since C++20) 1.6 Typedefs 1.7 Predefined standard stream objects 1.8 I/O Manipulators 1.9 Types 1.10 Error category interface (since C++11) 2 Print functions (since C++23) 3 C-style I/O 4 See also [ edit ] Stream-based I/O The stream-based input/output library is organized around abstract input/output devices. These abstract devices allow the same code to handle input/output to files, memory streams, or custom adaptor devices that perform arbitrary operations (e.g. compression) on the fly. Most of the classes are templated, so they can be adapted to any basic character type. Separate typedefs are provided for the most common basic character types ( char and wchar_t ). The classes are organized into the following hierarchy: Inheritance diagram Abstraction Defined in header <ios> ios_base manages formatting flags and input/output exceptions (class) [edit] basic_ios

They bring all the performance benefits of std::format , are locale-independent by default, reduce global state, avoid allocating a temporary std::string object and calling operator << , and in general make formatting more efficient compared to iostreams and stdio . The following print-like functions are provided: Defined in header <print> print (C++23) prints to stdout or a file stream using formatted representation of the arguments (function template) [edit] println (C++23) same as std::print except that each print is terminated by additional new line (function template) [edit] vprint_unicode vprint_unicode_buffered (C++23) prints to Unicode capable stdout or a file stream using type-erased argument representation (function) [edit] vprint_nonunicode vprint_nonunicode_buffered (C++23) prints to stdout or a file stream using type-erased argument representation (function) [edit] Defined in header <ostream> print (std::ostream) (C++23) outputs formatted representation of the arguments (function template) [edit] println (std::ostream) (C++23) outputs formatted representation of the arguments with appended ' \n ' (function template) [edit] [ edit ] C-style I/O C++ also includes the input/output functions defined by C , such as std::fopen , std::getc , etc. [ edit ] See also Filesystem library (since C++17) Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io&oldid=179905 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages العربية Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Polski Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 28 January 2025, at 12:21.
