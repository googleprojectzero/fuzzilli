The iterator library provides definitions for iterators, as well as iterator traits, adaptors, and utility functions. Since iterators are an abstraction of pointers, their semantics are a generalization of most of the semantics of pointers in C++. This ensures that every function template that takes iterators works as well with regular pointers.

(See also LegacyIterator for the most basic kind of iterator.) Instead of being defined by specific types, each category of iterator is defined by the operations that can be performed on it. This definition means that any type that supports the necessary operations can be used as an iterator -- for example, a pointer supports all of the operations required by LegacyRandomAccessIterator , so a pointer can be used anywhere a LegacyRandomAccessIterator is expected. All of the iterator categories (except LegacyOutputIterator ) can be organized into a hierarchy, where more powerful iterator categories (e.g. LegacyRandomAccessIterator ) support the operations of less powerful categories (e.g. LegacyInputIterator ). If an iterator falls into one of these categories and also satisfies the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator , then it is called a mutable iterator and supports both input and output. Non-mutable iterators are called constant iterators. Iterators are called constexpr iterators if all operations provided to meet iterator category requirements are constexpr functions . (since C++20) Iterator category Operations and storage requirement write read increment decrement random access contiguous storage without multiple passes with multiple passes LegacyIterator Required LegacyOutputIterator Required Required LegacyInputIterator (mutable if supports write operation) Required Required LegacyForwardIterator (also satisfies LegacyInputIterator ) Required Required Required LegacyBidirectionalIterator (also satisfies LegacyForwardIterator ) Required Required Required Required LegacyRandomAccessIterator (also satisfies LegacyBidirectionalIterator ) Required Required Required Required Required LegacyContiguousIterator [1] (also satisfies LegacyRandomAccessIterator ) Required Required Required Required Required Required ↑ LegacyContiguousIterator category was only formally specified in C++17, but the iterators of std::vector , std::basic_string , std::array , and std::valarray , as well as pointers into C arrays are often treated as a separate category in pre-C++17 code. Note: A type supporting the required operations in a row of the table above does not necessarily fall into the corresponding category, see the category page for the complete list of requirements. [ edit ] Definitions [ edit ] Types and writability An input iterator i supports the expression * i , resulting in a value of some object type T , called the value type of the iterator. An output iterator i has a non-empty set of types that are writable (until C++20) indirectly_writable (since C++20) to the iterator; for each such type T , the expression * i = o is valid where o is a value of type T . For every iterator type X for which equality is defined (until C++20) , there is a corresponding signed integer (until C++20) integer-like (since C++20) type called the difference type of the iterator. [ edit ] Dereferenceability and validity Just as a regular pointer to an array guarantees that there is a pointer value pointing past the last element of the array, so for any iterator type there is an iterator value that points past the last element of a corresponding sequence. Such a value is called a past-the-end value. Values of an iterator i for which the expression * i is defined are called dereferenceable . The standard library never assumes that past-the-end values are dereferenceable. Iterators can also have singular values that are not associated with any sequence. Results of most expressions are undefined for singular values; the only exceptions are the assignment of a non-singular value to an iterator that holds a singular value, destroying an iterator that holds a singular value, and, for iterators that meet the DefaultConstructible requirements, using a value-initialized iterator as the source of a copy or move (since C++11) operation. In these cases the singular value is overwritten the same way as any other value. Dereferenceable values are always non-singular. An invalid iterator is an iterator that may be singular. [ edit ] Ranges Most of the standard library’s algorithmic templates that operate on data structures have interfaces that use ranges. An iterator j is called reachable from an iterator i if and only if there is a finite sequence of applications of the expression ++ i that makes i == j . If j is reachable from i , they refer to elements of the same sequence. A range is a pair of iterators that designate the beginning and end of the computation. A range [ i , i ) is an empty range; in general, a range [ i , j ) refers to the elements in the data structure starting with the element pointed to by i and up to but not including the element pointed to by j . Range [ i , j ) is valid if and only if j is reachable from i . (until C++20) A range can be denoted by either [ i , s ) , with an iterator i and a sentinel s that designate the beginning and end of the computation ( i and s can have different types), or i + [ ​ 0 ​ , n ) , with an iterator i and a count n that designate the beginning and the number of elements to which the computation is to be applied. Iterator-sentinel range An iterator and a sentinel denoting a range are comparable. [ i , s ) is empty if i == s ; otherwise, [ i , s ) refers to the elements in the data structure starting with the element pointed to by i and up to but not including the element, if any, pointed to by the first iterator j such that j == s . A sentinel s is called reachable from an iterator i if and only if there is a finite sequence of applications of the expression ++ i that makes i == s . If s is reachable from i , [ i , s ) denotes a valid range. Counted range A counted range i + [ ​ 0 ​ , n ) is empty if n == 0 ; otherwise, i + [ ​ 0 ​ , n ) refers to the n elements in the data structure starting with the element pointed to by i and up to but not including the element, if any, pointed to by the result of n applications of ++ i . A counted range i + [ ​ 0 ​ , n ) is valid if and only if n == 0 ; or all of the following conditions are satisfied: n is positive, i is dereferenceable, and ++ i + [ ​ 0 ​ , -- n ) is valid. (since C++20) The result of the application of functions in the standard library to invalid ranges is undefined. [ edit ] Iterator concepts (since C++20) A new system of iterators based on concepts that are different from C++17 iterators.
