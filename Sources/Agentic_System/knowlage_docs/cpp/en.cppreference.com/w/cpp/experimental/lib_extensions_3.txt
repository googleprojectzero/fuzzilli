Components merged into C++17/20 and the following components are removed in LFTS v3: std::experimental::make_array , std::experimental::erased_type , std::experimental::packaged_task , and std::experimental::promise . [ edit ] Scope guard Defined in header <experimental/scope> scope_exit wraps a function object and invokes it on exiting the scope (class template) [edit] scope_fail wraps a function object and invokes it on exiting the scope through an exception (class template) [edit] scope_success wraps a function object and invokes it on exiting the scope normally (class template) [edit] unique_resource universal RAII resource handle wrapper (class template) [edit] [ edit ] Feature test macros Defined in header <experimental/memory_resource> __cpp_lib_experimental_memory_resources a value of at least 201803 indicates that resource_adaptor is supported (macro constant) Defined in header <experimental/functional> __cpp_lib_experimental_function_polymorphic_allocator a value of at least 202211 indicates that std:: pmr :: polymorphic_allocator <> is used for std::experimental::function (macro constant) Defined in header <experimental/scope> __cpp_lib_experimental_scope a value of at least 201902 indicates that the scope guards are supported (macro constant) [ edit ] Notes The value of __cpp_lib_experimental_memory_resources has been increased in LFTS v3, because the design of resource_adaptor is rebased onto std::pmr::memory_resource .
