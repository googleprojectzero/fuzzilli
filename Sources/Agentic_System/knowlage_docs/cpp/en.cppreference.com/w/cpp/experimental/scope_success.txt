A scope_success may be either active, i.e. calls its exit function on destruction, or inactive, i.e. does nothing on destruction. A scope_success is active after constructed from an exit function. A scope_success can become inactive by calling release() on it either manually or automatically (by the move constructor). An inactive scope_success may also be obtained by initializing with another inactive scope_success . Once a scope_success is inactive, it cannot become active again. A scope_success effectively holds an EF and a bool flag indicating if it is active, alongwith a counter of uncaught exceptions used for detecting whether the destructor is called during stack unwinding.

Constructing a scope_success is constructed from another scope_success created in a different thread might also lead to unexpected behavior since the count of uncaught exceptions obtained in different threads may be compared during the destruction. If the EF stored in a scope_success object refers to a local variable of the function where it is defined, e.g., as a lambda capturing the variable by reference, and that variable is used as a return operand in that function, that variable might have already been returned when the scope_success 's destructor executes, calling the exit function. This can lead to surprising behavior.
