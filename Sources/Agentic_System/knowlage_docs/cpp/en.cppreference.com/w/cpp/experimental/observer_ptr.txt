The observer stores a pointer to a second object, known as the watched object . An observer_ptr may also have no watched object. An observer is not responsible in any way for the watched object; there is no inherent relationship between an observer and the object it watches. It is intended as a near drop-in replacement for raw pointer types, with the advantage that, as a vocabulary type, it indicates its intended use without need for detailed analysis by code readers. Specializations of observer_ptr satisfy the requirements of CopyConstructible and CopyAssignable . Type requirements - W shall not be a reference type, but may be an incomplete type.
