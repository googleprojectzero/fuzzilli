The default-constructed std::istreambuf_iterator is known as the end-of-stream iterator. When a std::istreambuf_iterator reaches the end of the underlying stream, it becomes equal to the end-of-stream iterator. Dereferencing or incrementing it further invokes undefined behavior. std::istreambuf_iterator has a trivial copy constructor, a constexpr default constructor, and a trivial destructor.

A proxy object holds a char_type character and a streambuf_type* pointer. Dereferencing a proxy object with operator* yields the stored character. ( exposition-only member type* ) Member types iterator_category , value_type , difference_type , pointer and reference are required to be obtained by inheriting from std:: iterator < std:: input_iterator_tag , CharT, typename Traits :: off_type , /* unspecified */ , CharT > . (until C++17) The member type pointer is usually CharT* (see below ).

It is expected that given an std::istreambuf_iterator i , the expressions ( * i ) . m and i - > m have the same effect. However, the resolution does not provide a formal specification of its behavior. Thus it is implemented differently, including returning nullptr , returning the address of a temporary, or does even provide the member at all. Its intended behavior can hardly be achieved, and it is removed by the resolution of LWG issue 2790 . The resolution of LWG issue 659 also made the member type pointer unspecified in order to allow operator-> to return a proxy. This is to allow operator-> to compile when CharT is not a class type. [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <iostream> #include <iterator> #include <sstream> #include <string> int main ( ) { // typical use case: an input stream represented as a pair of iterators std:: istringstream in { "Hello, world" } ; std :: istreambuf_iterator < char > it { in } , end ; std:: string ss { it, end } ; std:: cout << "ss has " << ss. size ( ) << " bytes; " "it holds \" " << ss << " \" \n " ; // demonstration of the single-pass nature std:: istringstream s { "abc" } ; std :: istreambuf_iterator < char > i1 { s } , i2 { s } ; std:: cout << "i1 returns '" << * i1 << "' \n " "i2 returns '" << * i2 << "' \n " ; ++ i1 ; std:: cout << "after incrementing i1, but not i2: \n " "i1 returns '" << * i1 << "' \n " "i2 returns '" << * i2 << "' \n " ; ++ i2 ; std:: cout << "after incrementing i2, but not i1: \n " "i1 returns '" << * i1 << "' \n " "i2 returns '" << * i2 << "' \n " ; } Output: ss has 12 bytes; it holds "Hello, world" i1 returns 'a' i2 returns 'a' after incrementing i1, but not i2: i1 returns 'b' i2 returns 'b' after incrementing i2, but not i1: i1 returns 'c' i2 returns 'c' [ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards. DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior LWG 659 C++98 1. std::istreambuf_iterator did not have operator - > 2. the member type pointer was specified as CharT* 1. added 2. made unspecified LWG 2790 C++98 the operator - > added by LWG issue 659 was not useful removed [ edit ] See also ostreambuf_iterator output iterator that writes to std::basic_streambuf (class template) [edit] istream_iterator input iterator that reads from std::basic_istream (class template) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/iterator/istreambuf_iterator&oldid=179750 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 17 January 2025, at 18:14.
