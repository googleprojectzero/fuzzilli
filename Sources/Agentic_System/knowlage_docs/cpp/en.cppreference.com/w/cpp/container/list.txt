Fast random access is not supported. It is usually implemented as a doubly-linked list. Compared to std::forward_list this container provides bidirectional iteration capability while being less space efficient. Adding, removing and moving the elements within the list or across several lists does not invalidate the iterators or references. An iterator is invalidated only when the corresponding element is deleted. std::list meets the requirements of Container , AllocatorAwareContainer , SequenceContainer and ReversibleContainer . All member functions of std::list are constexpr : it is possible to create and use std::list objects in the evaluation of a constant expression. However, std::list objects generally cannot be constexpr , because any dynamically allocated storage must be released in the same evaluation of constant expression.

T must meet the requirements of CopyConstructible . T must meet the requirements of CopyAssignable if list::operator= or list::assign is instantiated with T . (until C++11) The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend on the actual operations performed on the container. Generally, it is required that element type is a complete type and meets the requirements of Erasable , but many member functions impose stricter requirements. (since C++11) (until C++17) The requirements that are imposed on the elements depend on the actual operations performed on the container. Generally, it is required that element type meets the requirements of Erasable , but many member functions impose stricter requirements. This container (but not its members) can be instantiated with an incomplete element type if the allocator satisfies the allocator completeness requirements .
