Search, insertion, and removal have average constant-time complexity. Internally, the elements are not sorted in any particular order, but organized into buckets. Which bucket an element is placed into depends entirely on the hash of its value. This allows fast access to individual elements, since once a hash is computed, it refers to the exact bucket the element is placed into. Container elements may not be modified (even by non const iterators) since modification could change an element's hash and corrupt the container. std::unordered_set meets the requirements of Container , AllocatorAwareContainer , UnorderedAssociativeContainer . All member functions of std::unordered_set are constexpr : it is possible to create and use std::unordered_set objects in the evaluation of a constant expression. However, std::unordered_set objects generally cannot be constexpr , because any dynamically allocated storage must be released in the same evaluation of constant expression.

References and pointers to data stored in the container are only invalidated by erasing that element, even when the corresponding iterator is invalidated. After container move assignment, unless elementwise move assignment is forced by incompatible allocators, references, pointers, and iterators (other than the past-the-end iterator) to moved-from container remain valid, but refer to elements that are now in * this .

This means defining a pair of function overloads using the two types as parameter types may violate the One Definition Rule . Since iterator is convertible to const_iterator , a single function with a const_iterator as parameter type will work instead.
