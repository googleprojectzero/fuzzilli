Sorting is done using the key comparison function Compare . Search, removal, and insertion operations have logarithmic complexity. Sets are usually implemented as Red–black trees . Everywhere the standard library uses the Compare requirements, uniqueness is determined by using the equivalence relation. In imprecise terms, two objects a and b are considered equivalent if neither compares less than the other: ! comp ( a, b ) && ! comp ( b, a ) . std::set meets the requirements of Container , AllocatorAwareContainer , AssociativeContainer and ReversibleContainer . All member functions of std::set are constexpr : it is possible to create and use std::set objects in the evaluation of a constant expression. However, std::set objects generally cannot be constexpr , because any dynamically allocated storage must be released in the same evaluation of constant expression.

This means defining a pair of function overloads using the two types as parameter types may violate the One Definition Rule . Since iterator is convertible to const_iterator , a single function with a const_iterator as parameter type will work instead.
