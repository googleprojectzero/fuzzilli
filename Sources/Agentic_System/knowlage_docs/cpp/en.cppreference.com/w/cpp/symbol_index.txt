The symbols are written as follows: Function names with () . Templates with <> . Symbols from std 's sub-namespaces (e.g. chrono ) are not listed here, but the namespace names (prepended with the icon ▶) are the links to the corresponding pages. Macro symbols , exposition-only symbols and symbols removed from the standard library are listed in separated pages.
