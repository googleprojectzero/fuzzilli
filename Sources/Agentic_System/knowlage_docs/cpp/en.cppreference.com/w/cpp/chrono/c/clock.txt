To convert result value to seconds divide it by CLOCKS_PER_SEC . Only the difference between two values returned by different calls to std::clock is meaningful, as the beginning of the std::clock era does not have to coincide with the start of the program. std::clock time may advance faster or slower than the wall clock, depending on the execution resources given to the program by the operating system. For example, if the CPU is shared by other processes, std::clock time may advance slower than wall clock. On the other hand, if the current process is multithreaded and more than one execution core is available, std::clock time may advance faster than wall clock. Contents 1 Return value 2 Exceptions 3 Notes 4 Example 5 See also [ edit ] Return value Processor time used by the program so far. If the processor time used is not available, returns ( std:: clock_t ) ( - 1 ) . If the value of the processor time used cannot be represented by std::clock_t , returns an unspecified value. [ edit ] Exceptions Throws nothing. [ edit ] Notes On POSIX-compatible systems, clock_gettime with clock id CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID offers better resolution. The value returned by clock() may wrap around on some implementations. For example, on such an implementation, if std::clock_t is a signed 32-bit integer and CLOCKS_PER_SEC is 1 '000' 000 , it will wrap after about 2147 seconds (about 36 minutes). [ edit ] Example This example demonstrates the difference between clock() time and real time. Run this code #include <chrono> #include <ctime> #include <iomanip> #include <iostream> #include <thread> // The function f() does some time-consuming work. void f ( ) { volatile double d = 0 ; for ( int n = 0 ; n ! = 10000 ; ++ n ) for ( int m = 0 ; m ! = 10000 ; ++ m ) d + = d * n * m ; } int main ( ) { const std:: clock_t c_start = std :: clock ( ) ; auto t_start = std:: chrono :: high_resolution_clock :: now ( ) ; std:: thread t1 ( f ) ; std:: thread t2 ( f ) ; // f() is called on two threads t1. join ( ) ; t2. join ( ) ; const std:: clock_t c_end = std :: clock ( ) ; const auto t_end = std:: chrono :: high_resolution_clock :: now ( ) ; std:: cout << std:: fixed << std:: setprecision ( 2 ) << "CPU time used: " << 1000.0 * ( c_end - c_start ) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC << "ms \n " << "Wall clock time passed: " << std:: chrono :: duration < double , std:: milli > ( t_end - t_start ) << ' \n ' ; } Possible output: CPU time used: 1590.00ms Wall clock time passed: 808.23ms [ edit ] See also ctime converts a std::time_t object to a textual representation (function) [edit] time returns the current time of the system as time since epoch (function) [edit] C documentation for clock Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/chrono/c/clock&oldid=180250 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 7 February 2025, at 19:13.
