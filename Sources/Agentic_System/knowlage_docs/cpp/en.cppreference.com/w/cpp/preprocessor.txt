The result of preprocessing is a single file which is then passed to the actual compiler. Contents 1 Directives 2 Capabilities 3 Defect reports 4 See also [ edit ] Directives The preprocessing directives control the behavior of the preprocessor. Each directive occupies one line and has the following format: the # character. a sequence of: a standard-defined directive name (listed below ) followed by the corresponding arguments, or one or more preprocessing tokens where the beginning token is not a standard-defined directive name, in this case the directive is conditionally-supported with implementation-defined semantics (e.g. a common non-standard extension is the directive #warning which emits a user-defined message during compilation) (until C++23) , or nothing, in this case the directive has no effect. a line break. The module and import directives are also preprocessing directives. (since C++20) Preprocessing directives must not come from macro expansion. #define EMPTY EMPTY # include <file.h> // not a preprocessing directive [ edit ] Capabilities The preprocessor has the source file translation capabilities: conditionally compile parts of source file (controlled by directive #if , #ifdef , #ifndef , #else , #elif , #elifdef , #elifndef (since C++23) , and #endif ). replace text macros while possibly concatenating or quoting identifiers (controlled by directives #define and #undef , and operators # and ## ). include other files (controlled by directive #include and checked with __has_include (since C++17) ). cause an error or warning (since C++23) (controlled by directive #error or #warning respectively (since C++23) ). The following aspects of the preprocessor can be controlled: implementation-defined behavior (controlled by directive #pragma and operator _Pragma (since C++11) ). In addition, some compilers support (to varying degrees) the operator __pragma as a non-standard extension. file name and line information available to the preprocessor (controlled by directive #line ). [ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards. DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior CWG 2001 C++98 the behavior of using non-standard-defined directives was not clear made conditionally-supported [ edit ] See also C++ documentation for Predefined Macro Symbols C++ documentation for Macro Symbol Index C documentation for preprocessor Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/preprocessor&oldid=156005 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages العربية Česky Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 한국어 Polski Português Русский Türkçe 中文 This page was last modified on 1 August 2023, at 01:04.
