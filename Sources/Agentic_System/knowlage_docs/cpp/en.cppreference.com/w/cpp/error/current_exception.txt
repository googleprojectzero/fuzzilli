The referenced object remains valid at least as long as there is an exception_ptr object that refers to it. If the implementation of this function requires a call to new and the call fails, the returned pointer will hold a reference to an instance of std::bad_alloc . If the implementation of this function requires copying the captured exception object and its copy constructor throws an exception, the returned pointer will hold a reference to the exception thrown. If the copy constructor of the thrown exception object also throws, the returned pointer may hold a reference to an instance of std::bad_exception to break the endless loop. If the function is called when no exception is being handled, an empty std::exception_ptr is returned. This function can be called in a std::terminate_handler to retrieve the exception which has provoked the invocation of std::terminate . Contents 1 Return value 2 Notes 3 Example 4 See also [ edit ] Return value An instance of std::exception_ptr holding a reference to the exception object, or a copy of the exception object, or to an instance of std::bad_alloc or to an instance of std::bad_exception . [ edit ] Notes On the implementations that follow Itanium C++ ABI (GCC, Clang, etc), exceptions are allocated on the heap when thrown (except for std::bad_alloc in some cases), and this function simply creates the smart pointer referencing the previously-allocated object, On MSVC, exceptions are allocated on stack when thrown, and this function performs the heap allocation and copies the exception object. On Windows in managed CLR environments [1] , the implementation will store a std::bad_exception when the current exception is a managed exception ( [2] ). Note that catch ( ... ) catches also managed exceptions: #include <exception> int main ( ) { try { throw gcnew System :: Exception ( "Managed exception" ) ; } catch ( ... ) { std:: exception_ptr ex = std :: current_exception ( ) ; try { std:: rethrow_exception ( ex ) ; } catch ( std:: bad_exception const & ) { // This will be printed. std:: cout << "Bad exception" << std:: endl ; } } } Feature-test macro Value Std Feature __cpp_lib_constexpr_exceptions 202411L (C++26) constexpr for exception types [ edit ] Example [edit] Run this code #include <exception> #include <iostream> #include <stdexcept> #include <string> void handle_eptr ( std:: exception_ptr eptr ) // passing by value is OK { try { if ( eptr ) std:: rethrow_exception ( eptr ) ; } catch ( const std:: exception & e ) { std:: cout << "Caught exception: '" << e. what ( ) << "' \n " ; } } int main ( ) { std:: exception_ptr eptr ; try { [ [ maybe_unused ] ] char ch = std:: string ( ) . at ( 1 ) ; // this generates a std::out_of_range } catch ( ... ) { eptr = std :: current_exception ( ) ; // capture } handle_eptr ( eptr ) ; } // destructor for std::out_of_range called here, when the eptr is destructed Possible output: Caught exception: 'basic_string::at: __n (which is 1) >= this->size() (which is 0)' [ edit ] See also exception_ptr (C++11) shared pointer type for handling exception objects (typedef) [edit] rethrow_exception (C++11) throws the exception from an std::exception_ptr (function) [edit] make_exception_ptr (C++11) creates an std::exception_ptr from an exception object (function template) [edit] uncaught_exception uncaught_exceptions ( removed in C++20* ) (C++17) checks if exception handling is currently in progress (function) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/error/current_exception&oldid=177869 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 24 November 2024, at 13:26.
