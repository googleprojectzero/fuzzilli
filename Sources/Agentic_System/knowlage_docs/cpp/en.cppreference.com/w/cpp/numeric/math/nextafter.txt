The library provides overloads of std::nextafter for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameters from and to . (since C++23) 4-6) If from equals to , to is returned, converted from long double to the return type of the function without loss of range or precision. The library provides overloads of std::nexttoward for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter from . However, an invocation of std::nexttoward is ill-formed if the argument corresponding to from has extended floating-point type , because the next representable value (or to ) is not guaranteed to be representable as long double . (since C++23) A) Additional std::nextafter overloads are provided for all other combinations of arithmetic types. B) Additional std::nexttoward overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double . Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Error handling 4 Notes 5 Example 6 See also [ edit ] Parameters from, to - floating-point or integer values [ edit ] Return value If no errors occur, the next representable value of from in the direction of to . is returned. If from equals to , then to is returned. If a range error due to overflow occurs, ±HUGE_VAL , ±HUGE_VALF , or ±HUGE_VALL is returned (with the same sign as from ). If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result is returned. [ edit ] Error handling Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling . If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559), if from is finite, but the expected result is an infinity, raises FE_INEXACT and FE_OVERFLOW . if from does not equal to and the result is subnormal or zero, raises FE_INEXACT and FE_UNDERFLOW . in any case, the returned value is independent of the current rounding mode. if either from or to is NaN, NaN is returned. [ edit ] Notes POSIX specifies that the overflow and the underflow conditions are range errors ( errno may be set). IEC 60559 recommends that from is returned whenever from == to . These functions return to instead, which makes the behavior around zero consistent: std :: nextafter ( - 0.0 , + 0.0 ) returns + 0.0 and std :: nextafter ( + 0.0 , - 0.0 ) returns - 0.0 . std::nextafter is typically implemented by manipulation of IEEE representation ( glibc , musl ). The additional std::nextafter overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A) . They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first argument num1 and second argument num2 : If num1 or num2 has type long double , then std :: nextafter ( num1, num2 ) has the same effect as std :: nextafter ( static_cast < long double > ( num1 ) , static_cast < long double > ( num2 ) ) . Otherwise, if num1 and/or num2 has type double or an integer type, then std :: nextafter ( num1, num2 ) has the same effect as std :: nextafter ( static_cast < double > ( num1 ) , static_cast < double > ( num2 ) ) . Otherwise, if num1 or num2 has type float , then std :: nextafter ( num1, num2 ) has the same effect as std :: nextafter ( static_cast < float > ( num1 ) , static_cast < float > ( num2 ) ) . (until C++23) If num1 and num2 have arithmetic types, then std :: nextafter ( num1, num2 ) has the same effect as std :: nextafter ( static_cast < /*common-floating-point-type*/ > ( num1 ) , static_cast < /*common-floating-point-type*/ > ( num2 ) ) , where /*common-floating-point-type*/ is the floating-point type with the greatest floating-point conversion rank and greatest floating-point conversion subrank between the types of num1 and num2 , arguments of integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion rank as double . If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate from the overloads provided. (since C++23) The additional std::nexttoward overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (B) . They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std :: nexttoward ( num ) has the same effect as std :: nexttoward ( static_cast < double > ( num ) ) .
