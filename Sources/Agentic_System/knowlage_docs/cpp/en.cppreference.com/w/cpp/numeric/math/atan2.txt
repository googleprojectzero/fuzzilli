The library provides overloads of std::atan2 for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameters. (since C++23) S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise std::atan2 on v_y and v_x . (See math-common-simd-t for its definition.) (since C++26) A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double . (since C++11) Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Error handling 4 Notes 5 Example 6 See also [ edit ] Parameters y, x - floating-point or integer values [ edit ] Return value If no errors occur, the arc tangent of y / x ( arctan( y x ) ) in the range [-π, +π] radians, is returned. y argument Return value x argument If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported). If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned. [ edit ] Error handling Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling . Domain error may occur if x and y are both zero. If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559), If x and y are both zero, domain error does not occur. If x and y are both zero, range error does not occur either. If y is zero, pole error does not occur. If y is ±0 and x is negative or -0, ±π is returned. If y is ±0 and x is positive or +0, ±0 is returned. If y is ±∞ and x is finite, ±π/2 is returned. If y is ±∞ and x is -∞, ±3π/4 is returned. If y is ±∞ and x is +∞, ±π/4 is returned. If x is ±0 and y is negative, -π/2 is returned. If x is ±0 and y is positive, +π/2 is returned. If x is -∞ and y is finite and positive, +π is returned. If x is -∞ and y is finite and negative, -π is returned. If x is +∞ and y is finite and positive, +0 is returned. If x is +∞ and y is finite and negative, -0 is returned. If either x is NaN or y is NaN, NaN is returned. [ edit ] Notes std :: atan2 ( y, x ) is equivalent to std:: arg ( std:: complex < std:: common_type_t < decltype ( x ) , decltype ( y ) >> ( x, y ) ) . POSIX specifies that in case of underflow, the value y / x is returned, and if that is not supported, an implementation-defined value no greater than DBL_MIN , FLT_MIN , and LDBL_MIN is returned. The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A) . They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first argument num1 and second argument num2 : If num1 or num2 has type long double , then std :: atan2 ( num1, num2 ) has the same effect as std :: atan2 ( static_cast < long double > ( num1 ) , static_cast < long double > ( num2 ) ) . Otherwise, if num1 and/or num2 has type double or an integer type, then std :: atan2 ( num1, num2 ) has the same effect as std :: atan2 ( static_cast < double > ( num1 ) , static_cast < double > ( num2 ) ) . Otherwise, if num1 or num2 has type float , then std :: atan2 ( num1, num2 ) has the same effect as std :: atan2 ( static_cast < float > ( num1 ) , static_cast < float > ( num2 ) ) . (until C++23) If num1 and num2 have arithmetic types, then std :: atan2 ( num1, num2 ) has the same effect as std :: atan2 ( static_cast < /*common-floating-point-type*/ > ( num1 ) , static_cast < /*common-floating-point-type*/ > ( num2 ) ) , where /*common-floating-point-type*/ is the floating-point type with the greatest floating-point conversion rank and greatest floating-point conversion subrank between the types of num1 and num2 , arguments of integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion rank as double . If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate from the overloads provided.
