It is thread-local. Each thread inherits the initial state of its floating-point environment from the parent thread. Floating-point operations modify the floating-point status flags to indicate abnormal results or auxiliary information. The state of floating-point control modes affects the outcomes of some floating-point operations. The floating-point environment access and modification is only meaningful when #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS is supported and is set to ON . Otherwise the implementation is free to assume that floating-point control modes are always the default ones and that floating-point status flags are never tested or modified. In practice, few current compilers, such as HP aCC, Oracle Studio, or IBM XL, support the #pragma explicitly, but most compilers allow meaningful access to the floating-point environment anyway.

When a floating-point operation raises a floating-point exception, the status of the floating-point environment changes, which can be tested with std::fetestexcept , but the execution of a C++ program on most implementations continues uninterrupted. There are compiler extensions that may be used to generate C++ exceptions automatically whenever a floating-point exception is raised: GNU libc function feenableexcept() enables trapping of the floating-point exceptions, which generates the signal SIGFPE . If the compiler option -fnon-call-exceptions was used, the handler for that signal may throw a user-defined C++ exception. MSVC function _control87() enables trapping of the floating-point exceptions, which generates a hardware exception, which can be converted to C++ exceptions with _set_se_translator .
