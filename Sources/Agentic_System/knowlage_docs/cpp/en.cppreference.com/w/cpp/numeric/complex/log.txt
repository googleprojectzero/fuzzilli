Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Error handling and special values 4 Notes 5 Example 6 Defect reports 7 See also [ edit ] Parameters z - complex value [ edit ] Return value If no errors occur, the complex natural logarithm of z is returned, in the range of a strip in the interval [−iπ, +iπ] along the imaginary axis and mathematically unbounded along the real axis. [ edit ] Error handling and special values Errors are reported consistent with math_errhandling . If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic, The function is continuous onto the branch cut taking into account the sign of imaginary part std:: log ( std:: conj ( z ) ) == std:: conj ( std:: log ( z ) ) If z is (-0,+0) , the result is (-∞,π) and FE_DIVBYZERO is raised If z is (+0,+0) , the result is (-∞,+0) and FE_DIVBYZERO is raised If z is (x,+∞) (for any finite x), the result is (+∞,π/2) If z is (x,NaN) (for any finite x), the result is (NaN,NaN) and FE_INVALID may be raised If z is (-∞,y) (for any finite positive y), the result is (+∞,π) If z is (+∞,y) (for any finite positive y), the result is (+∞,+0) If z is (-∞,+∞) , the result is (+∞,3π/4) If z is (+∞,+∞) , the result is (+∞,π/4) If z is (±∞,NaN) , the result is (+∞,NaN) If z is (NaN,y) (for any finite y), the result is (NaN,NaN) and FE_INVALID may be raised If z is (NaN,+∞) , the result is (+∞,NaN) If z is (NaN,NaN) , the result is (NaN,NaN) [ edit ] Notes The natural logarithm of a complex number z with polar coordinate components (r,θ) equals ln r + i(θ+2nπ) , with the principal value ln r + iθ . The semantics of this function are intended to be consistent with the C function clog .
