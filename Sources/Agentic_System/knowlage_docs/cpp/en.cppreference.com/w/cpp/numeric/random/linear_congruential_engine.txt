Contents 1 Template parameters 2 Generator properties 3 Predefined specializations 4 Nested types 5 Data members 6 Member functions 6.1 Construction and Seeding 6.2 Generation 6.3 Characteristics 7 Non-member functions 8 Example [ edit ] Template parameters UIntType - The result type generated by the generator. The effect is undefined if this is not one of unsigned short , unsigned int , unsigned long , or unsigned long long . a - the multiplier term c - the increment term m - the modulus term When m is not zero, if a >= m or c >= m is true , the program is ill-formed. [ edit ] Generator properties The size of the states of linear_congruential_engine is 1 , each of them consists of a single integer. The actual modulus \(\scriptsize m_0\) m 0 is defined as follows: If m is not zero, \(\scriptsize m_0\) m 0 is m . If m is zero, \(\scriptsize m_0\) m 0 is the value of std:: numeric_limits < result_type > :: max ( ) plus 1 (which means \(\scriptsize m_0\) m 0 need not be representable as result_type ). The transition algorithm of linear_congruential_engine is \(\scriptsize TA(x_i) = (a \cdot x_i + c)\mod m_0\) TA(x i ) = (a·x i +c) mod m 0 . The generation algorithm of linear_congruential_engine is \(\scriptsize GA(x_i) = (a \cdot x_i + c)\mod m_0\) GA(x i ) = (a·x i +c) mod m 0 . The pseudo-random number generated with the current state is also the successor state.
