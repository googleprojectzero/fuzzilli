The library provides overloads of std::remainder for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameters. (since C++23) S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise std::remainder on v_x and v_y . (See math-common-simd-t for its definition.) (since C++26) A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double . (since C++11) The IEEE floating-point remainder of the division operation x / y calculated by this function is exactly the value x - quo * y , where the value quo is the integral value nearest the exact value x / y . When |quo - x / y| = ½ , the value quo is chosen to be even. In contrast to std::fmod , the returned value is not guaranteed to have the same sign as x . If the returned value is zero, it will have the same sign as x . Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Error handling 4 Notes 5 Example 6 See also [ edit ] Parameters x, y - floating-point or integer values [ edit ] Return value If successful, returns the IEEE floating-point remainder of the division x / y as defined above. If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported). If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result is returned. If y is zero, but the domain error does not occur, zero is returned. [ edit ] Error handling Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling . Domain error may occur if y is zero. If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559), The current rounding mode has no effect. FE_INEXACT is never raised, the result is always exact. If x is ±∞ and y is not NaN, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised. If y is ±0 and x is not NaN, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised. If either argument is NaN, NaN is returned. [ edit ] Notes POSIX requires that a domain error occurs if x is infinite or y is zero. std::fmod , but not std::remainder is useful for doing silent wrapping of floating-point types to unsigned integer types: ( 0.0 <= ( y = std:: fmod ( std:: rint ( x ) , 65536.0 ) ) ) ? y : 65536.0 + y is in the range [ - 0.0 , 65535.0 ] , which corresponds to unsigned short , but std :: remainder ( std:: rint ( x ) , 65536.0 ) is in the range [ - 32767.0 , + 32768.0 ] , which is outside of the range of signed short . The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A) . They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first argument num1 and second argument num2 : If num1 or num2 has type long double , then std :: remainder ( num1, num2 ) has the same effect as std :: remainder ( static_cast < long double > ( num1 ) , static_cast < long double > ( num2 ) ) . Otherwise, if num1 and/or num2 has type double or an integer type, then std :: remainder ( num1, num2 ) has the same effect as std :: remainder ( static_cast < double > ( num1 ) , static_cast < double > ( num2 ) ) . Otherwise, if num1 or num2 has type float , then std :: remainder ( num1, num2 ) has the same effect as std :: remainder ( static_cast < float > ( num1 ) , static_cast < float > ( num2 ) ) . (until C++23) If num1 and num2 have arithmetic types, then std :: remainder ( num1, num2 ) has the same effect as std :: remainder ( static_cast < /*common-floating-point-type*/ > ( num1 ) , static_cast < /*common-floating-point-type*/ > ( num2 ) ) , where /*common-floating-point-type*/ is the floating-point type with the greatest floating-point conversion rank and greatest floating-point conversion subrank between the types of num1 and num2 , arguments of integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion rank as double . If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate from the overloads provided.
