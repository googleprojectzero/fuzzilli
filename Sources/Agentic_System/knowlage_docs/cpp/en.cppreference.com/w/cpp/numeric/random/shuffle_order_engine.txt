It maintains a table of size K and delivers a randomly selected number from that table when requested, replacing it with a number generated by the base engine. The following typedef defines the random number engine with one commonly used parameter set: Defined in header <random> Type Definition knuth_b (C++11) std :: shuffle_order_engine < std:: minstd_rand0 , 256 > [edit] Contents 1 Template parameters 2 Member types 3 Member functions 3.1 Generation 3.2 Characteristics 4 Non-member functions 5 Member objects 6 Example [ edit ] Template parameters Engine - the type of the wrapped engine K - the size of the internal table.
