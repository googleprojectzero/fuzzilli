If s is not a null pointer, inspects at most n bytes of the multibyte character string, beginning with the byte pointed to by s to determine the number of bytes necessary to complete the next multibyte character (including any shift sequences). If the function determines that the next multibyte character in s is complete and valid, converts it to UTF-8 and stores the first UTF-8 code unit in * pc8 (if pc8 is not null). If UTF-8 encoding of the multibyte character in * s consists of more than one UTF-8 code unit, then after the first call to this function, * ps is updated in such a way that the next call to mbrtoc8 will write out the additional UTF-8 code units, without considering * s . If s is a null pointer, the values of n and pc8 are ignored and the call is equivalent to std :: mbrtoc8 ( nullptr, "" , 1 , ps ) . If UTF-8 code unit produced is u8 ' \0 ' , the conversion state * ps represents the initial shift state. The multibyte encoding used by this function is specified by the currently active C locale. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Example 4 See also [ edit ] Parameters pc8 - pointer to the location where the resulting UTF-8 code units will be written s - pointer to the multibyte character string used as input n - limit on the number of bytes in s that can be examined ps - pointer to the conversion state object used when interpreting the multibyte string [ edit ] Return value The first of the following that applies: ​ 0 ​ if the character converted from s (and stored in * pc8 if non-null) was the null character. the number of bytes [ 1 ... n ] of the multibyte character successfully converted from s . static_cast < std:: size_t > ( - 3 ) if the next UTF-8 code unit from a character whose encoding consists of multiple code units has now been written to * pc8 . No bytes are processed from the input in this case. static_cast < std:: size_t > ( - 2 ) if the next n bytes constitute an incomplete, but so far valid, multibyte character. Nothing is written to * pc8 . static_cast < std:: size_t > ( - 1 ) if encoding error occurs. Nothing is written to * pc8 , the value EILSEQ is stored in errno and the value of * ps is unspecified.
