Converted characters are stored in the successive elements of the char array pointed to by dst . No more than len bytes are written to the destination array. Each character is converted as if by a call to std::wctomb , except that the wctomb's conversion state is unaffected. The conversion stops if: The null character was converted and stored. A wchar_t was found that does not correspond to a valid character in the current C locale. The next multibyte character to be stored would exceed len . Contents 1 Notes 2 Parameters 3 Return value 4 Example 5 See also [ edit ] Notes In most implementations, this function updates a global static object of type std::mbstate_t as it processes through the string, and cannot be called simultaneously by two threads, std:: wcsrtombs should be used in such cases. POSIX specifies a common extension: if dst is a null pointer, this function returns the number of bytes that would be written to dst , if converted. Similar behavior is standard for std:: wcsrtombs . [ edit ] Parameters dst - pointer to narrow character array where the multibyte character will be stored src - pointer to the first element of a null-terminated wide string to convert len - number of byte available in the array pointed to by dst [ edit ] Return value On success, returns the number of bytes (including any shift sequences, but excluding the terminating ' \0 ' ) written to the character array whose first element is pointed to by dst . On conversion error (if invalid wide character was encountered), returns static_cast < std:: size_t > ( - 1 ) .
