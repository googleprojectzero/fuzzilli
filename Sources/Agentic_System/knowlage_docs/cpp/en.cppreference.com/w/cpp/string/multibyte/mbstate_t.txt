Zero-initialized value of mbstate_t represents the initial conversion state, although other values of mbstate_t may exist that also represent the initial conversion state. Possible implementation of mbstate_t is a struct type holding an array representing the incomplete multibyte character, an integer counter indicating the number of bytes in the array that have been processed, and a representation of the current shift state. The following functions should not be called from multiple threads without synchronization with the std :: mbstate_t * argument of a null pointer due to possible data races: std::mbrlen , std::mbrtowc , std::mbsrtowcs , std::mbtowc , std::wcrtomb , std::wcsrtombs , std::wctomb .
