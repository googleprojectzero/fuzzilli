The defined operation set is such that generic algorithms almost always can be implemented in terms of it. It is thus possible to use such algorithms with almost any possible character or string type, just by supplying a customized char_traits class. The char_traits class template serves as a basis for explicit instantiations. The user can provide a specialization for any custom character types. Several explicit specializations are provided for the standard character types (see below), other specializations are not required to satisfy the requirements of CharTraits . Contents 1 Specializations 1.1 Member types 1.2 Member functions 2 Notes 3 Example 4 See also [ edit ] Specializations The standard library provides the following standard specializations: Defined in header <string> std :: char_traits < char > the standard character traits of char std :: char_traits < wchar_t > the standard character traits of wchar_t std :: char_traits < char8_t > (C++20) the standard character traits of char8_t std :: char_traits < char16_t > (C++11) the standard character traits of char16_t std :: char_traits < char32_t > (C++11) the standard character traits of char32_t All these specializations satisfy the requirements of CharTraits . [ edit ] Member types The standard specializations define the following member types required by CharTraits : CharT Member type char_type int_type off_type pos_type state_type char char int std::streamoff std::streampos std::mbstate_t wchar_t wchar_t std::wint_t std::wstreampos char8_t char8_t unsigned int std::u8streampos char16_t char16_t std::uint_least16_t std::u16streampos char32_t char32_t std::uint_least32_t std::u32streampos On top of that, the standard specializations also define the member type comparison_category as std::strong_ordering . (since C++20) [ edit ] Member functions The standard specializations define the following static member functions required by CharTraits : assign [static] assigns a character (public static member function) [edit] eq lt [static] compares two characters (public static member function) [edit] move [static] moves one character sequence onto another (public static member function) [edit] copy [static] copies a character sequence (public static member function) [edit] compare [static] lexicographically compares two character sequences (public static member function) [edit] length [static] returns the length of a character sequence (public static member function) [edit] find [static] finds a character in a character sequence (public static member function) [edit] to_char_type [static] converts int_type to equivalent char_type (public static member function) [edit] to_int_type [static] converts char_type to equivalent int_type (public static member function) [edit] eq_int_type [static] compares two int_type values (public static member function) [edit] eof [static] returns an eof value (public static member function) [edit] not_eof [static] checks whether a character is eof value (public static member function) [edit] [ edit ] Notes CharTraits does not require defining the types and functions listed above as direct members, it only requires types like X::type and expressions like X :: func ( args ) are valid and have the required semantics. Users-defined character traits can be derived from other character traits classes and only override some of their members, see the example below. [ edit ] Example User-defined character traits may be used to provide case-insensitive comparison : Run this code #include <cctype> #include <iostream> #include <string> #include <string_view> struct ci_char_traits : public std :: char_traits < char > { static char to_upper ( char ch ) { return std:: toupper ( ( unsigned char ) ch ) ; } static bool eq ( char c1, char c2 ) { return to_upper ( c1 ) == to_upper ( c2 ) ; } static bool lt ( char c1, char c2 ) { return to_upper ( c1 ) < to_upper ( c2 ) ; } static int compare ( const char * s1, const char * s2, std:: size_t n ) { while ( n -- ! = 0 ) { if ( to_upper ( * s1 ) < to_upper ( * s2 ) ) return - 1 ; if ( to_upper ( * s1 ) > to_upper ( * s2 ) ) return 1 ; ++ s1 ; ++ s2 ; } return 0 ; } static const char * find ( const char * s, std:: size_t n, char a ) { const auto ua { to_upper ( a ) } ; while ( n -- ! = 0 ) { if ( to_upper ( * s ) == ua ) return s ; s ++ ; } return nullptr ; } } ; template < class DstTraits, class CharT, class SrcTraits > constexpr std:: basic_string_view < CharT, DstTraits > traits_cast ( const std:: basic_string_view < CharT, SrcTraits > src ) noexcept { return { src. data ( ) , src. size ( ) } ; } int main ( ) { using namespace std :: literals ; constexpr auto s1 = "Hello" sv ; constexpr auto s2 = "heLLo" sv ; if ( traits_cast < ci_char_traits > ( s1 ) == traits_cast < ci_char_traits > ( s2 ) ) std:: cout << s1 << " and " << s2 << " are equal \n " ; } Output: Hello and heLLo are equal [ edit ] See also basic_string stores and manipulates sequences of characters (class template) [edit] basic_string_view (C++17) read-only string view (class template) [edit] basic_istream wraps a given abstract device ( std::basic_streambuf ) and provides high-level input interface (class template) [edit] basic_ostream wraps a given abstract device ( std::basic_streambuf ) and provides high-level output interface (class template) [edit] basic_streambuf abstracts a raw device (class template) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/string/char_traits&oldid=158926 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 12 September 2023, at 16:24.
