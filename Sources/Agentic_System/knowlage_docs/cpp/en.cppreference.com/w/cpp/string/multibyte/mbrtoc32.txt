If s is not a null pointer, inspects at most n bytes of the multibyte character string, beginning with the byte pointed to by s to determine the number of bytes necessary to complete the next multibyte character (including any shift sequences). If the function determines that the next multibyte character in s is complete and valid, converts it to the corresponding 32-bit character and stores it in * pc32 (if pc32 is not null). If the multibyte character in * s corresponds to a multi-char32_t sequence (not possible with UTF-32), then after the first call to this function, * ps is updated in such a way that the next calls to mbrtoc32 will write out the additional char32_t , without considering * s . If s is a null pointer, the values of n and pc32 are ignored and the call is equivalent to std :: mbrtoc32 ( nullptr, "" , 1 , ps ) . If the wide character produced is the null character, the conversion state * ps represents the initial shift state. The multibyte encoding used by this function is specified by the currently active C locale. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Examples 4 See also [ edit ] Parameters pc32 - pointer to the location where the resulting 32-bit character will be written s - pointer to the multibyte character string used as input n - limit on the number of bytes in s that can be examined ps - pointer to the conversion state object used when interpreting the multibyte string [ edit ] Return value The first of the following that applies: ​ 0 ​ if the character converted from s (and stored in * pc32 if non-null) was the null character. the number of bytes [ 1 ... n ] of the multibyte character successfully converted from s . - 3 if the next char32_t from a multi- char32_t character has now been written to * pc32 . No bytes are processed from the input in this case. - 2 if the next n bytes constitute an incomplete, but so far valid, multibyte character. Nothing is written to * pc32 . - 1 if encoding error occurs. Nothing is written to * pc32 , the value EILSEQ is stored in errno and the value of * ps is unspecified.
