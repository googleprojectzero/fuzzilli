If dst is not null, converted characters are stored in the successive elements of the char array pointed to by dst . No more than len bytes are written to the destination array. Each character is converted as if by a call to std::wcrtomb . The conversion stops if: The null character was converted and stored. src is set to a null pointer and * ps represents the initial shift state. A wchar_t was found that does not correspond to a valid character in the current C locale. src is set to point at the first unconverted wide character. The next multibyte character to be stored would exceed len . src is set to point at the first unconverted wide character. This condition is not checked if dst is a null pointer. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Example 4 See also [ edit ] Parameters dst - pointer to narrow character array where the multibyte characters will be stored src - pointer to pointer to the first element of a null-terminated wide string len - number of bytes available in the array pointed to by dst ps - pointer to the conversion state object [ edit ] Return value On success, returns the number of bytes (including any shift sequences, but excluding the terminating ' \0 ' ) written to the character array whose first element is pointed to by dst . If dst is a null pointer, returns the number of bytes that would have been written (again, excluding the terminating null character ' \0 ' ). On conversion error (if invalid wide character was encountered), returns static_cast < std:: size_t > ( - 1 ) , stores EILSEQ in errno , and leaves * ps in unspecified state.
