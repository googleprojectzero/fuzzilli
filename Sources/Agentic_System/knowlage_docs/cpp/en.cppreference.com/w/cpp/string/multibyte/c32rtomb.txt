If s is not a null pointer, the function determines the number of bytes necessary to store the multibyte character representation of c32 (including any shift sequences, and taking into account the current multibyte conversion state * ps ), and stores the multibyte character representation in the character array whose first element is pointed to by s , updating * ps as necessary. At most MB_CUR_MAX bytes can be written by this function. If s is a null pointer, the call is equivalent to std :: c32rtomb ( buf, U ' \0 ' , ps ) for some internal buffer buf . If c32 is the null wide character U ' \0 ' , a null byte is stored, preceded by any shift sequence necessary to restore the initial shift state and the conversion state parameter * ps is updated to represent the initial shift state. The multibyte encoding used by this function is specified by the currently active C locale. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Example 4 See also [ edit ] Parameters s - pointer to narrow character array where the multibyte character will be stored c32 - the 32-bit character to convert ps - pointer to the conversion state object used when interpreting the multibyte string [ edit ] Return value On success, returns the number of bytes (including any shift sequences) written to the character array whose first element is pointed to by s . This value may be ​ 0 ​ , e.g. when processing the first char32_t in multi- char32_t -character sequence (does not occur in UTF-32). On failure (if c32 is not a valid 32-bit character), returns - 1 , stores EILSEQ in errno , and leaves * ps in unspecified state.
