This is typically possible for the characters from the ASCII character set, since most multibyte encodings (such as UTF-8) use single bytes to encode those characters. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Example 4 See also [ edit ] Parameters c - wide character to narrow [ edit ] Return value EOF if c does not represent a multibyte character with length 1 in initial shift state. Otherwise, the single-byte representation of c as unsigned char converted to int . [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <clocale> #include <cwchar> #include <iostream> void try_narrowing ( wchar_t c ) { int cn = std :: wctob ( c ) ; if ( cn ! = EOF ) std:: cout << ' \' ' << int ( c ) << "' narrowed to " << + cn << ' \n ' ; else std:: cout << ' \' ' << int ( c ) << "' could not be narrowed \n " ; } int main ( ) { std:: setlocale ( LC_ALL , "th_TH.utf8" ) ; std:: cout << std:: hex << std:: showbase << "In Thai UTF-8 locale: \n " ; try_narrowing ( L 'a' ) ; try_narrowing ( L '๛' ) ; std:: setlocale ( LC_ALL , "th_TH.tis620" ) ; std:: cout << "In Thai TIS-620 locale: \n " ; try_narrowing ( L 'a' ) ; try_narrowing ( L '๛' ) ; } Output: In Thai UTF-8 locale: '0x61' narrowed to 0x61 '0xe5b' could not be narrowed In Thai TIS-620 locale: '0x61' narrowed to 0x61 '0xe5b' narrowed to 0xfb [ edit ] See also btowc widens a single-byte narrow character to wide character, if possible (function) [edit] narrow narrows characters (public member function of std::basic_ios<CharT,Traits> ) [edit] narrow invokes do_narrow (public member function of std::ctype<CharT> ) [edit] C documentation for wctob Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/string/multibyte/wctob&oldid=153090 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 9 June 2023, at 23:51.
