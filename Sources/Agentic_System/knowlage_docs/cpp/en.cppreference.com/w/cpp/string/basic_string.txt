The class is dependent neither on the character type nor on the nature of operations on that type. The definitions of the operations are supplied via the Traits template parameter - a specialization of std::char_traits or a compatible traits class. The elements of a basic_string are stored contiguously, that is, for a basic_string s , & * ( s. begin ( ) + n ) == & * s. begin ( ) + n for any n in [ ​ 0 ​ , s. size ( ) ) , and * ( s. begin ( ) + s. size ( ) ) has value CharT ( ) (a null terminator) (since C++11) ; or, equivalently, a pointer to s [ 0 ] can be passed to functions that expect a pointer to the first element of an array (until C++11) a null-terminated array (since C++11) of CharT . std::basic_string satisfies the requirements of AllocatorAwareContainer (except that customized construct / destroy are not used for construction/destruction of elements), SequenceContainer and ContiguousContainer (since C++17) . If any of Traits::char_type and Allocator::value_type is different from CharT , the program is ill-formed. All member functions of std::basic_string are constexpr : it is possible to create and use std::basic_string objects in the evaluation of a constant expression. However, std::basic_string objects generally cannot be constexpr , because any dynamically allocated storage must be released in the same evaluation of constant expression. (since C++20) Several typedefs for common character types are provided: Defined in header <string> Type Definition std::string std :: basic_string < char > std::wstring std :: basic_string < wchar_t >

(since C++17) [ edit ] Iterator invalidation References, pointers, and iterators referring to the elements of a basic_string may be invalidated by any standard library function taking a reference to non-const basic_string as an argument, such as std::getline , std::swap , or operator>> , and by calling non-const member functions, except operator[] , at , data , front , back , begin , rbegin , end , and rend . [ edit ] Notes Although it is required that customized construct or destroy is used when constructing or destroying elements of std::basic_string until C++23, all implementations only used the default mechanism. The requirement is corrected by P1072R10 to match existing practice.

DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior LWG 530 C++98 contiguity of the storage for elements of basic_string was accidently made not required by LWG259 required again LWG 2861 C++98 value_type was Traits::char_type changed to CharT LWG 2994 ( P1148R0 ) C++98 the behavior is undefined if any of Traits::char_type [1] and Allocator::char_type is different from CharT the program is ill-formed in this case ↑ The Traits::char_type case is fixed in P1148R0 .
