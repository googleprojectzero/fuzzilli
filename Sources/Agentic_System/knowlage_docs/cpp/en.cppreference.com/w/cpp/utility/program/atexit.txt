Same applies to the ordering between static object constructors and the calls to atexit : see std::exit . (until C++11) The functions may be called concurrently with the destruction of the objects with static storage duration and with each other, maintaining the guarantee that if registration of A was sequenced-before the registration of B, then the call to B is sequenced-before the call to A, same applies to the sequencing between static object constructors and calls to atexit : see std::exit . (since C++11) The same function may be registered more than once. If a function exits via an exception, std::terminate is called. atexit is thread-safe: calling the function from several threads does not induce a data race. The implementation is guaranteed to support the registration of at least 32 functions. The exact limit is implementation-defined. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Notes 4 Example 5 See also [ edit ] Parameters func - pointer to a function to be called on normal program termination [ edit ] Return value ​ 0 ​ if the registration succeeds, nonzero value otherwise. [ edit ] Notes The two overloads are distinct because the types of the parameter func are distinct ( language linkage is part of its type). [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <cstdlib> #include <iostream> void atexit_handler_1 ( ) { std:: cout << "At exit #1 \n " ; } void atexit_handler_2 ( ) { std:: cout << "At exit #2 \n " ; } int main ( ) { const int result_1 = std :: atexit ( atexit_handler_1 ) ; const int result_2 = std :: atexit ( atexit_handler_2 ) ; if ( result_1 || result_2 ) { std:: cerr << "Registration failed! \n " ; return EXIT_FAILURE ; } std:: cout << "Returning from main... \n " ; return EXIT_SUCCESS ; } Output: Returning from main...
