If no characters match the pattern or if the value obtained by parsing the matched characters is not representable in the type of value , value is unmodified, otherwise the characters matching the pattern are interpreted as a text representation of an arithmetic value, which is stored in value . 1) Integer parsers: Expects the pattern identical to the one used by std::strtol in the default ("C") locale and the given non-zero numeric base, except that "0x" or "0X" prefixes are not recognized if base is 16 only the minus sign is recognized (not the plus sign), and only for signed integer types of value leading whitespace is not ignored. The library provides overloads for all cv-unqualified (since C++23) signed and unsigned integer types and char as the referenced type of the parameter value . 2) Floating-point parsers: Expects the pattern identical to the one used by std::strtod in the default ("C") locale, except that the plus sign is not recognized outside of the exponent (only the minus sign is permitted at the beginning) if fmt has std::chars_format::scientific set but not std::chars_format::fixed , the exponent part is required (otherwise it is optional) if fmt has std::chars_format::fixed set but not std::chars_format::scientific , the optional exponent is not permitted if fmt is std::chars_format::hex , the prefix "0x" or "0X" is not permitted (the string "0x123" parses as the value "0" with unparsed remainder "x123" ) leading whitespace is not ignored. In any case, the resulting value is one of at most two floating-point values closest to the value of the string matching the pattern, after rounding according to std::round_to_nearest . The library provides overloads for all cv-unqualified standard (until C++23) floating-point types as the referenced type of the parameter value . Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Exceptions 4 Notes 5 Example 6 Defect reports 7 See also [ edit ] Parameters first, last - valid character range to parse value - the out-parameter where the parsed value is stored if successful base - integer base to use: a value between 2 and 36 (inclusive). fmt - floating-point formatting to use, a bitmask of type std::chars_format [ edit ] Return value On success, returns a value of type std::from_chars_result such that ptr points at the first character not matching the pattern, or has the value equal to last if all characters match and ec is value-initialized. If there is no pattern match, returns a value of type std::from_chars_result such that ptr equals first and ec equals std::errc::invalid_argument . value is unmodified. If the pattern was matched, but the parsed value is not in the range representable by the type of value , returns value of type std::from_chars_result such that ec equals std::errc::result_out_of_range and ptr points at the first character not matching the pattern. value is unmodified. [ edit ] Exceptions Throws nothing. [ edit ] Notes Unlike other parsing functions in C++ and C libraries, std::from_chars is locale-independent, non-allocating, and non-throwing. Only a small subset of parsing policies used by other libraries (such as std::sscanf ) is provided. This is intended to allow the fastest possible implementation that is useful in common high-throughput contexts such as text-based interchange ( JSON or XML ). The guarantee that std::from_chars can recover every floating-point value formatted by std::to_chars exactly is only provided if both functions are from the same implementation. A pattern consisting of a sign with no digits following it is treated as pattern that did not match anything.
