It satisfies the requirement of AllocatorAwareContainer , SequenceContainer , and ReversibleContainer , except that only move, assignment, swap, and operations for const-qualified sequence containers are supported, and the semantics of comparison functions are different from those required for a container. 2) Convenience type alias for the basic_stacktrace using the default std::allocator . 3) Convenience type alias for the basic_stacktrace using the polymorphic allocator . The invocation sequence of the current evaluation \(\small{ {x}_{0} }\) x 0 in the current thread of execution is a sequence \(\small{ ({x}_{0}, \dots, {x}_{n})}\) (x 0 , ..., x n ) of evaluations such that, for \(\small{i \ge 0}\) i≥0 , \(\small{ {x}_{i} }\) x i is within the function invocation \(\small{ {x}_{i+1} }\) x i+1 . A stacktrace is an approximate representation of an invocation sequence and consists of stacktrace entries. A stacktrace entry represents an evaluation in a stacktrace. It is represented by std::stacktrace_entry in the C++ standard library.

Users can allocate stacktrace_entry objects on the stack or in some other place, where appropriate. The sequence of std::stacktrace_entry objects owned by a std::basic_stacktrace is immutable, and either is empty or represents a contiguous interval of the whole stacktrace. boost :: stacktrace :: basic_stacktrace (available in Boost.Stacktrace ) can be used instead when std::basic_stacktrace is not available.
