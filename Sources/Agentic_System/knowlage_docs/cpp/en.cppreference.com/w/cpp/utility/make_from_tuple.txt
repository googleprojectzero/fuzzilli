Given the exposition-only function /*make-from-tuple-impl*/ defined as follows: template < class T, tuple-like Tuple, std:: size_t ... I > // no constraint on Tuple before C++23 constexpr T /*make-from-tuple-impl*/ ( Tuple && t, std:: index_sequence < I... > ) { return T ( std :: get < I > ( std:: forward < Tuple > ( t ) ) ... ) ; } The effect is equivalent to: return /*make-from-tuple-impl*/ < T > ( std:: forward < Tuple > ( t ) , std:: make_index_sequence < std:: tuple_size_v < std:: remove_reference_t < Tuple >>> { } ) ; . If std:: tuple_size_v < std:: remove_reference_t < Tuple >> is 1 and std :: reference_constructs_from_temporary_v < T, decltype ( std :: get < 0 > ( std:: declval < Tuple > ( ) ) ) > is true , or (since C++23) std:: is_constructible_v < T, decltype ( std :: get < I > ( std:: declval < Tuple > ( ) ) ) ... > is false , the program is ill-formed. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Notes 4 Example 5 Defect reports 6 See also [ edit ] Parameters t - tuple whose elements to be used as arguments to the constructor of T [ edit ] Return value The constructed T object or reference. [ edit ] Notes Tuple need not be std::tuple , and instead may be anything that supports std::get and std::tuple_size ; in particular, std::array and std::pair may be used. (until C++23) Tuple is constrained to be tuple-like, i.e. each type therein is required to be a specialization of std::tuple or another type (such as std::array and std::pair ) that models tuple-like . (since C++23) Due to guaranteed copy elision , T need not be movable.
