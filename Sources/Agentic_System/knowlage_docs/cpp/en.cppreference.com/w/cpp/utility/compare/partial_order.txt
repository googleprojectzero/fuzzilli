Let t and u be expressions and T and U denote decltype ( ( t ) ) and decltype ( ( u ) ) respectively, std :: partial_order ( t, u ) is expression-equivalent to: If std:: is_same_v < std:: decay_t < T > , std:: decay_t < U >> is true : std:: partial_ordering ( partial_order ( t, u ) ) , if it is a well-formed expression with overload resolution performed in a context that does not include a declaration of std::partial_order , otherwise, std:: partial_ordering ( std:: compare_three_way ( ) ( t, u ) ) , if it is well-formed, otherwise, std:: partial_ordering ( std:: weak_order ( t, u ) ) , if it is well-formed. In all other cases, the expression is ill-formed, which can result in substitution failure when it appears in the immediate context of a template instantiation. Customization point objects The name std::partial_order denotes a customization point object , which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. See CustomizationPointObject for details.
