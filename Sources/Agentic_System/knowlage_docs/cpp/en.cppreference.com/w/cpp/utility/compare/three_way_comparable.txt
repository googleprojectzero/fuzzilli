Comparing mixed operands yields results equivalent to comparing the operands converted to their common type. __WeaklyEqualityComparableWith , __PartiallyOrderedWith , and __ComparisonCommonTypeWith are exposition-only concepts.

Contents 1 Semantic requirements 2 Equality preservation 3 Implicit expression variations 4 See also [ edit ] Semantic requirements These concepts are modeled only if they are satisfied and all concepts they subsume are modeled. 1) T and Cat model std :: three_way_comparable < T, Cat > only if, given lvalues a and b of type const std:: remove_reference_t < T > , following are true: ( a <=> b == 0 ) == bool ( a == b ) , ( a <=> b ! = 0 ) == bool ( a ! = b ) , ( ( a <=> b ) <=> 0 ) and ( 0 <=> ( b <=> a ) ) are equal, bool ( a > b ) == bool ( b < a ) , bool ( a >= b ) == ! bool ( a < b ) , bool ( a <= b ) == ! bool ( b < a ) , ( a <=> b < 0 ) == bool ( a < b ) , ( a <=> b > 0 ) == bool ( a > b ) , ( a <=> b <= 0 ) == bool ( a <= b ) , and ( a <=> b >= 0 ) == bool ( a >= b ) , and if Cat is convertible to std::strong_ordering , T models totally_ordered . 2) T , U , and Cat model std :: three_way_comparable_with < T, U, Cat > only if given t and t2 , lvalues denoting distinct equal objects of types const std:: remove_reference_t < T > and std:: remove_reference_t < T > respectively, and u and u2 , lvalues denoting distinct equal objects of types const std:: remove_reference_t < U > and std:: remove_reference_t < U > respectively. Let C be std:: common_reference_t < const std:: remove_reference_t < T > & , const std:: remove_reference_t < U > & > and given an expression E and a type C , let CONVERT_TO < C > ( E ) be: static_cast < C > ( std:: as_const ( E ) ) . (until C++23) static_cast < const C & > ( std:: as_const ( E ) ) if that is a valid expression, static_cast < const C & > ( std :: move ( E ) ) otherwise. (since C++23) the following are true: t <=> u and u <=> t have the same domain, ( ( t <=> u ) <=> 0 ) and ( 0 <=> ( u <=> t ) ) are equal, ( t <=> u == 0 ) == bool ( t == u ) , ( t <=> u ! = 0 ) == bool ( t ! = u ) , Cat ( t <=> u ) == Cat ( CONVERT_TO < C > ( t2 ) <=> CONVERT_TO < C > ( u2 ) ) , ( t <=> u < 0 ) == bool ( t < u ) , ( t <=> u > 0 ) == bool ( t > u ) , ( t <=> u <= 0 ) == bool ( t <= u ) , ( t <=> u >= 0 ) == bool ( t >= u ) , and if Cat is convertible to std::strong_ordering , T and U model std:: totally_ordered_with < T, U > . [ edit ] Equality preservation Expressions declared in requires expressions of the standard library concepts are required to be equality-preserving (except where stated otherwise). [ edit ] Implicit expression variations A requires expression that uses an expression that is non-modifying for some constant lvalue operand also requires implicit expression variations . [ edit ] See also equality_comparable equality_comparable_with (C++20) specifies that operator == is an equivalence relation (concept) [edit] totally_ordered totally_ordered_with (C++20) specifies that the comparison operators on the type yield a total order (concept) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/utility/compare/three_way_comparable&oldid=158782 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español 日本語 Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 11 September 2023, at 10:48.
