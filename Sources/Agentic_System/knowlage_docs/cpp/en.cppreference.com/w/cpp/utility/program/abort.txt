Destructors of variables with automatic , thread local (since C++11) and static storage durations are not called. Functions registered with std::atexit() and std::at_quick_exit (since C++11) are also not called. Whether open resources such as files are closed is implementation defined. An implementation defined status is returned to the host environment that indicates unsuccessful execution. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Exceptions 4 Notes 5 Example 6 See also [ edit ] Parameters (none) [ edit ] Return value None because it does not return. [ edit ] Exceptions Throws nothing. [ edit ] Notes POSIX specifies that the abort() function overrides blocking or ignoring the SIGABRT signal. Some compiler intrinsics, e.g. __builtin_trap (gcc, clang, and icc) or __fastfail / __debugbreak (msvc), can be used to terminate the program as fast as possible.
