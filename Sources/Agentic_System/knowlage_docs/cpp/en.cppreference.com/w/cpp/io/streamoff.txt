Typically, this is an alias for long long . (since C++11) It is used to represent offsets from stream positions (values of type std::fpos ). A std::streamoff value constructed from - 1 is also used to represent error conditions by some of the I/O library functions. [ edit ] Relationship with std::fpos the difference between two std::fpos objects is a value of type std::streamoff a value of type std::streamoff may be added or subtracted from std::fpos yielding a different std::fpos . a value of type std::fpos is implicitly convertible to std::streamoff (the conversion result is the offset from the beginning of the file). a value of type std::fpos is constructible from a value of type std::streamoff [ edit ] See also fpos represents absolute position in a stream or a file (class template) [edit] seekg sets the input position indicator (public member function of std::basic_istream<CharT,Traits> ) [edit] seekp sets the output position indicator (public member function of std::basic_ostream<CharT,Traits> ) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/streamoff&oldid=137665 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 29 January 2022, at 07:46.
