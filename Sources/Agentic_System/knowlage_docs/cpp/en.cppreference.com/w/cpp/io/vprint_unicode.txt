Let out denote the character representation of formatting arguments provided by args formatted according to specifications given in fmt . Writes out to stream : If stream refers to a terminal that is only capable of displaying Unicode via a native Unicode API , flushes stream and writes out to the terminal using the native Unicode API. Otherwise, writes unmodified out to the stream . Unconditionally unlocks stream on function exit. If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined: stream is not a valid pointer to an output C stream. out contains invalid Unicode code units when the native Unicode API is used. 2) Equivalent to std:: string out = std:: vformat ( fmt, args ) ; std :: vprint_unicode ( stream, "{}" , std:: make_format_args ( out ) ) ; . 3) Equivalent to std :: vprint_unicode_buffered ( stdout , fmt, args ) . After writing characters to the output stream, establishes an observable checkpoint . (since C++26) Contents 1 Parameters 2 Exceptions 3 Notes 4 Example 5 Defect reports 6 See also 7 External links [ edit ] Parameters stream - output file stream to write to fmt - [edit] an object that represents the format string. The format string consists of ordinary characters (except { and } ), which are copied unchanged to the output, escape sequences { { and } } , which are replaced with { and } respectively in the output, and replacement fields. Each replacement field has the following format: { arg-id (optional) } (1) { arg-id (optional) : format-spec } (2) 1) replacement field without a format specification 2) replacement field with a format specification arg-id - specifies the index of the argument in args whose value is to be used for formatting; if it is omitted, the arguments are used in order. The arg-id ﻿s in a format string must all be present or all be omitted. Mixing manual and automatic indexing is an error. format-spec - the format specification defined by the std::formatter specialization for the corresponding argument. Cannot start with } . For basic types and standard string types, the format specification is interpreted as standard format specification . For chrono types, the format specification is interpreted as chrono format specification . For range types, the format specification is interpreted as range format specification . For std::pair and std::tuple , the format specification is interpreted as tuple format specification . For std::thread::id and std::stacktrace_entry , see thread id format specification and stacktrace entry format specification . For std::basic_stacktrace , no format specifier is allowed. (since C++23) For std::filesystem::path , see path format specification . (since C++26) For other formattable types, the format specification is determined by user-defined formatter specializations. args - arguments to be formatted [ edit ] Exceptions std::bad_alloc on allocation failure. std::system_error , if writing to the stream fails. Propagates any exception thrown by used formatters , e.g. std::format_error . [ edit ] Notes The C++ standard encourages the implementers to produce a diagnostic message if out contains invalid Unicode code units. On POSIX, writing to a terminal is done using the usual standard I/O functions, so there is no need to treat a terminal differently to any other file stream. On Windows, the stream refers to a terminal if GetConsoleMode ( _get_osfhandle ( _fileno ( stream ) ) ) returns nonzero (see Windows documentation for GetConsoleMode , _get_osfhandle , and _fileno ). The native Unicode API on Windows is WriteConsoleW . If invoking the native Unicode API requires transcoding, the invalid code units are substituted with U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (see "The Unicode Standard - Core Specification", Chapter 3.9 ).
