Contents 1 Parameters 2 Exceptions 3 Notes 4 Example 5 Defect reports 6 See also [ edit ] Parameters stream - output file stream to write to fmt - [edit] an object that represents the format string. The format string consists of ordinary characters (except { and } ), which are copied unchanged to the output, escape sequences { { and } } , which are replaced with { and } respectively in the output, and replacement fields. Each replacement field has the following format: { arg-id (optional) } (1) { arg-id (optional) : format-spec } (2) 1) replacement field without a format specification 2) replacement field with a format specification arg-id - specifies the index of the argument in args whose value is to be used for formatting; if it is omitted, the arguments are used in order. The arg-id ﻿s in a format string must all be present or all be omitted. Mixing manual and automatic indexing is an error. format-spec - the format specification defined by the std::formatter specialization for the corresponding argument. Cannot start with } . For basic types and standard string types, the format specification is interpreted as standard format specification . For chrono types, the format specification is interpreted as chrono format specification . For range types, the format specification is interpreted as range format specification . For std::pair and std::tuple , the format specification is interpreted as tuple format specification . For std::thread::id and std::stacktrace_entry , see thread id format specification and stacktrace entry format specification . For std::basic_stacktrace , no format specifier is allowed. (since C++23) For std::filesystem::path , see path format specification . (since C++26) For other formattable types, the format specification is determined by user-defined formatter specializations. args... - arguments to be formatted [ edit ] Exceptions std::bad_alloc on allocation failure. std::system_error , if writing to the stream fails. Propagates any exception thrown by used formatters , e.g. std::format_error .

[ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards. DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior P3107R5 C++23 only buffered printing operations can be performed can perform unbuffered printing operations P3235R3 C++23 the names of the functions added by P3107R5 were misleading changed the function names [ edit ] See also println (C++23) same as std::print except that each print is terminated by additional new line (function template) [edit] print (std::ostream) (C++23) outputs formatted representation of the arguments (function template) [edit] format (C++20) stores formatted representation of the arguments in a new string (function template) [edit] format_to (C++20) writes out formatted representation of its arguments through an output iterator (function template) [edit] printf fprintf sprintf snprintf (C++11) prints formatted output to stdout , a file stream or a buffer (function) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/print&oldid=180496 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Español 日本語 Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 11 February 2025, at 09:18.
