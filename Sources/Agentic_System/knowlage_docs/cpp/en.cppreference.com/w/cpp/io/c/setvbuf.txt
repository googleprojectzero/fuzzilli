In addition, If buffer is a null pointer, resizes the internal buffer to size . If buffer is not a null pointer, instructs the stream to use the user-provided buffer of size size beginning at buffer . The stream must be closed (with std::fclose ) before the lifetime of the array pointed to by buffer ends. The contents of the array after a successful call to std::setvbuf are indeterminate and any attempt to use it is undefined behavior. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Notes 4 Example 5 See also [ edit ] Parameters stream - the file stream to set the buffer to buffer - pointer to a buffer for the stream to use or null pointer to change size and mode only mode - buffering mode to use. It can be one of the following values: _IOFBF full buffering _IOLBF line buffering _IONBF no buffering size - size of the buffer [ edit ] Return value ​ 0 ​ on success or nonzero on failure. [ edit ] Notes This function may only be used after stream has been associated with an open file, but before any other operation (other than a failed call to std::setbuf / std::setvbuf ). Not all size bytes will necessarily be used for buffering: the actual buffer size is usually rounded down to a multiple of 2, a multiple of page size, etc. On many implementations, line buffering is only available for terminal input streams. A common error is setting the buffer of stdin or stdout to an array whose lifetime ends before the program terminates: int main ( ) { char buf [ BUFSIZ ] ; std:: setbuf ( stdin , buf ) ; } // lifetime of buf ends, undefined behavior The default buffer size BUFSIZ is expected to be the most efficient buffer size for file I/O on the implementation, but POSIX fstat often provides a better estimate. [ edit ] Example One use case for changing buffer size is when a better size is known. Run this code #include <cstdio> #include <cstdlib> #include <iostream> #include <sys/stat.h> int main ( ) { std:: FILE * fp = std:: fopen ( "/tmp/test.txt" , "w+" ) ; if ( ! fp ) { std:: perror ( "fopen" ) ; return EXIT_FAILURE ; } struct stat stats ; if ( fstat ( fileno ( fp ) , & stats ) == - 1 ) // POSIX only { std:: perror ( "fstat" ) ; return EXIT_FAILURE ; } std:: cout << "BUFSIZ is " << BUFSIZ << ", but optimal block size is " << stats. st_blksize << ' \n ' ; if ( std :: setvbuf ( fp, nullptr, _IOFBF , stats. st_blksize ) ! = 0 ) { std:: perror ( "setvbuf failed" ) ; // POSIX version sets errno return EXIT_FAILURE ; } // Read entire file: use truss/strace to observe the read(2) syscalls used for ( int ch ; ( ch = std:: fgetc ( fp ) ) ! = EOF ; ) { } std:: fclose ( fp ) ; return EXIT_SUCCESS ; } Possible output: BUFSIZ is 8192, but optimal block size is 65536 [ edit ] See also setbuf sets the buffer for a file stream (function) [edit] setbuf [virtual] provides user-supplied buffer or turns this filebuf unbuffered (virtual protected member function of std::basic_filebuf<CharT,Traits> ) [edit] C documentation for setvbuf Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/setvbuf&oldid=158998 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 13 September 2023, at 12:54.
