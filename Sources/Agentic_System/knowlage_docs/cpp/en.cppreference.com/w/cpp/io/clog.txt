These objects are guaranteed to be initialized during or before the first time an object of type std::ios_base::Init is constructed and are available for use in the constructors and destructors of static objects with ordered initialization (as long as <iostream> is included before the object is defined). Unless sync_with_stdio ( false ) has been issued, it is safe to concurrently access these objects from multiple threads for both formatted and unformatted output. [ edit ] Notes The “c” in the name refers to “character” ( stroustrup.com FAQ ); clog means “character log” and wclog means “wide character log”.
