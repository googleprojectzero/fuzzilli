Then, if seq. size ( ) < out. width ( ) , adds out. width ( ) - seq. size ( ) copies of the fill character out. fill ( ) either at the end of the sequence (if ios_base :: left is set in out. flags ( ) ) or at the beginning of the sequence (in all other cases). Finally, outputs each character from the resulting sequence as if by calling out. rdbuf ( ) - > sputn ( seq, n ) , where n = std:: max ( out. width ( ) , seq. size ( ) ) and out. width ( 0 ) to cancel the effects of std::setw , if any. 4) When used in an expression in >> quoted ( s, delim, escape ) , where in is an input stream with char_type equal to CharT and traits_type equal to Traits , extracts characters from in , using std::basic_istream::operator>> , according to the following rules: a) If the first character extracted does not equal delim (as determined by the stream's traits_type::eq ), then simply performs in >> s . b) Otherwise (if the first character is the delimiter): 1) Turns off the skipws flag on the input stream. 2) Empties the destination string by calling s. clear ( ) . 3) Extracts successive characters from in and appends them to s , except that whenever an escape character is extracted, it is ignored and the next character is appended to s . Extraction stops when ! in == true or when an unescaped delim character is found. 4) Discards the final (unescaped) delim character. 5) Restores the skipws flag on the input stream to its original value.
