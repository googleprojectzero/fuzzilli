It accumulates output in its own internal buffer, and atomically transmits its entire contents to the wrapped buffer on destruction and when explicitly requested, so that they appear as a contiguous sequence of characters. It guarantees that there are no data races and no interleaving of characters sent to the wrapped buffer as long as all other outputs made to the same buffer are made through, possibly different, instances of std::basic_syncbuf . Typical implementation of std::basic_syncbuf holds a pointer to the wrapped std::basic_streambuf , a boolean flag indicating whether the buffer will transmit its contents to the wrapped buffer on sync (flush), a boolean flag indicating a pending flush when the policy is to not emit on sync, an internal buffer that uses Allocator (such as std::string ), and a pointer to a mutex used to synchronize emit between multiple threads accessing the same wrapped stream buffer (these mutexes may be in a hash map with pointers to std::basic_streambuf objects used as keys). Like other streambuf classes, std::basic_syncbuf is normally only accessed through the corresponding stream, std::osyncstream , not directly. Several typedefs for common character types are provided: Defined in header <syncstream> Type Definition std::syncbuf std :: basic_syncbuf < char > std::wsyncbuf std :: basic_syncbuf < wchar_t > Contents 1 Member types 2 Member functions 3 Public member functions 4 Protected member functions 5 Non-member functions 6 Inherited from std:: basic_streambuf 6.1 Member types 6.2 Member functions 6.2.1 Locales 6.2.2 Positioning 6.2.3 Get area 6.2.4 Put area 6.2.5 Putback 6.3 Protected member functions 6.3.1 Locales 6.3.2 Positioning 6.3.3 Get area 6.3.4 Put area 6.3.5 Putback 6.4 Notes [ edit ] Member types Member type Definition char_type CharT [edit] traits_type Traits ; the program is ill-formed if Traits::char_type is not CharT .
