The objects are written as if by reinterpreting each object as an array of unsigned char and calling std::fputc size times for each object to write those unsigned char s into stream , in order. The file position indicator for the stream is advanced by the number of characters written. If the objects are not TriviallyCopyable , the behavior is undefined. If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator for the stream is indeterminate. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Example 4 See also [ edit ] Parameters buffer - pointer to the first object in the array to be written size - size of each object count - the number of the objects to be written stream - output file stream to write to [ edit ] Return value Number of objects written successfully, which may be less than count if an error occurred. If size or count is zero, fwrite returns zero and performs no other action.
