These objects are guaranteed to be initialized during or before the first time an object of type std::ios_base::Init is constructed and are available for use in the constructors and destructors of static objects with ordered initialization (as long as <iostream> is included before the object is defined). Unless std :: ios_base :: sync_with_stdio ( false ) has been issued, it is safe to concurrently access these objects from multiple threads for both formatted and unformatted output. By specification of std::cin , std:: cin . tie ( ) returns & std :: cout . This means that any input operation on std::cin executes std :: cout . flush ( ) (via std::basic_istream::sentry 's constructor). Similarly, std:: wcin . tie ( ) returns & std :: wcout . By specification of std::cerr , std:: cerr . tie ( ) returns & std :: cout . This means that any output operation on std::cerr executes std :: cout . flush ( ) (via std::basic_ostream::sentry 's constructor). Similarly, std:: wcerr . tie ( ) returns & std :: wcout . (since C++11) Notes The 'c' in the name refers to "character" ( stroustrup.com FAQ ); cout means "character output" and wcout means "wide character output". Because dynamic initialization of templated variables are unordered, it is not guaranteed that std::cout has been initialized to a usable state before the initialization of such variables begins, unless an object of type std::ios_base::Init has been constructed. Example Run this code #include <iostream> struct Foo { int n ; Foo ( ) { std :: cout << "static constructor \n " ; } ~Foo ( ) { std :: cout << "static destructor \n " ; } } ; Foo f ; // static object int main ( ) { std :: cout << "main function \n " ; } Output: static constructor main function static destructor See also Init initializes standard stream objects (public member class of std::ios_base ) [edit] cerr wcerr writes to the standard C error stream stderr , unbuffered (global object) [edit] clog wclog writes to the standard C error stream stderr (global object) [edit] stdin stdout stderr expression of type FILE * associated with the input stream expression of type FILE * associated with the output stream expression of type FILE * associated with the error output stream (macro constant) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/cout&oldid=181465 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 10 March 2025, at 21:46.
