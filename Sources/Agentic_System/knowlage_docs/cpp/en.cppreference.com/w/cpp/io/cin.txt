These objects are guaranteed to be initialized during or before the first time an object of type std::ios_base::Init is constructed and are available for use in the constructors and destructors of static objects with ordered initialization (as long as <iostream> is included before the object is defined). Unless sync_with_stdio ( false ) has been issued, it is safe to concurrently access these objects from multiple threads for both formatted and unformatted input. Once initialized: 1) std :: cin . tie() returns & std:: cout . This means that any input operation on std::cin forces a call to std:: cout . flush() if any characters are pending for output.. 2) std :: wcin . tie ( ) returns & std:: wcout . This means that any input operation on std::wcin forces a call to std:: wcout . flush ( ) if any characters are pending for output. [ edit ] Notes The “c” in the name refers to “character” ( stroustrup.com FAQ ); cin means “character input” and wcin means “wide character input”. [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <iostream> struct Foo { int n ; Foo ( ) { std:: cout << "Enter n: " ; // no flush needed std :: cin >> n ; } } ; Foo f ; // static object int main ( ) { std:: cout << "f.n is " << f. n << ' \n ' ; } Possible output: Enter n: 10 f.n is 10 [ edit ] See also Init initializes standard stream objects (public member class of std::ios_base ) [edit] cout wcout writes to the standard C output stream stdout (global object) [edit] stdin stdout stderr expression of type FILE * associated with the input stream expression of type FILE * associated with the output stream expression of type FILE * associated with the error output stream (macro constant) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/cin&oldid=181468 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 10 March 2025, at 22:09.
