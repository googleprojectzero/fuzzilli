Contents 1 Parameters 2 File access flags 3 Return value 4 Notes 5 Example 6 See also [ edit ] Parameters filename - file name to associate the file stream to mode - null-terminated character string determining file access mode [ edit ] File access flags File access mode string Meaning Explanation Action if file already exists Action if file does not exist "r" read Open a file for reading read from start return NULL and set error "w" write Create a file for writing destroy contents create new "a" append Append to a file write to end create new "r+" read extended Open a file for read/write read from start return NULL and set error "w+" write extended Create a file for read/write destroy contents create new "a+" append extended Open a file for read/write write to end create new File access mode flag "b" can optionally be specified to open a file in binary mode . This flag has no effect on POSIX systems, but on Windows, for example, it disables special handling of ' \n ' and ' \x1A ' . On the append file access modes, data is written to the end of the file regardless of the current position of the file position indicator. File access mode flag "x" can optionally be appended to "w" or "w+" specifiers. This flag forces the function to fail if the file exists, instead of overwriting it. (C++17) The behavior is undefined if the mode is not one of the strings listed above. Some implementations define additional supported modes (e.g. Windows ). [ edit ] Return value If successful, returns a pointer to the object that controls the opened file stream, with both eof and error bits cleared. The stream is fully buffered unless filename refers to an interactive device. On error, returns a null pointer. POSIX requires that errno is set in this case. [ edit ] Notes The format of filename is implementation-defined, and does not necessarily refer to a file (e.g. it may be the console or another device accessible through filesystem API). On platforms that support them, filename may include absolute or relative filesystem path. For portable directory and file naming, see C++ filesystem library or boost.filesystem . [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <cstdio> #include <cstdlib> int main ( ) { int is_ok = EXIT_FAILURE ; FILE * fp = std :: fopen ( "/tmp/test.txt" , "w+" ) ; if ( ! fp ) { std:: perror ( "File opening failed" ) ; return is_ok ; } int c ; // Note: int, not char, required to handle EOF while ( ( c = std:: fgetc ( fp ) ) ! = EOF ) // Standard C I/O file reading loop std:: putchar ( c ) ; if ( std:: ferror ( fp ) ) std:: puts ( "I/O error when reading" ) ; else if ( std:: feof ( fp ) ) { std:: puts ( "End of file reached successfully" ) ; is_ok = EXIT_SUCCESS ; } std:: fclose ( fp ) ; return is_ok ; } Output: End of file reached successfully [ edit ] See also fclose closes a file (function) [edit] fflush synchronizes an output stream with the actual file (function) [edit] freopen open an existing stream with a different name (function) [edit] C documentation for fopen Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/fopen&oldid=158672 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 10 September 2023, at 04:51.
