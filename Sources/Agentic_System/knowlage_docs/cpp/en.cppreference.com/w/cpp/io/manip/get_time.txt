The resultant value is stored in a std::tm object pointed to by tmb . Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Notes 4 Example 5 See also [ edit ] Parameters tmb - valid pointer to the std::tm object where the result will be stored fmt - pointer to a null-terminated CharT string specifying the conversion format The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers, whitespace characters, and ordinary characters (except % ). Each ordinary character is expected to match one character in the input stream in case-insensitive comparison. Each whitespace character matches arbitrary whitespace in the input string. Each conversion specification begins with % character, optionally followed by E or O modifier (ignored if unsupported by the locale), followed by the character that determines the behavior of the specifier. The format specifiers match the POSIX function strptime() : Conversion specifier Explanation Writes to fields % matches a literal % . The full conversion specification must be %% (none) t matches any whitespace (none) n matches any whitespace (none) Year Y parses full year as a 4 digit decimal number, leading zeroes permitted but not required tm_year EY parses year in the alternative representation, e.g.平成23年 (year Heisei 23) which writes 2011 to tm_year in ja_JP locale tm_year y parses last 2 digits of year as a decimal number. Range [69,99] results in values 1969 to 1999, range [00,68] results in 2000-2068 tm_year Oy parses last 2 digits of year using the alternative numeric system, e.g. 十一 is parsed as 11 in ja_JP locale tm_year Ey parses year as offset from locale's alternative calendar period %EC tm_year C parses the first 2 digits of year as a decimal number (range [00,99] ) tm_year EC parses the name of the base year (period) in the locale's alternative representation, e.g. 平成 (Heisei era) in ja_JP tm_year Month b parses the month name, either full or abbreviated, e.g. Oct tm_mon h synonym of b tm_mon B synonym of b tm_mon m parses the month as a decimal number (range [01,12] ), leading zeroes permitted but not required tm_mon Om parses the month using the alternative numeric system, e.g. 十二 parses as 12 in ja_JP locale tm_mon Week U parses the week of the year as a decimal number (Sunday is the first day of the week) (range [00,53] ), leading zeroes permitted but not required tm_year , tm_wday , tm_yday OU parses the week of the year , as by %U , using the alternative numeric system, e.g. 五十二 parses as 52 in ja_JP locale tm_year , tm_wday , tm_yday W parses the week of the year as a decimal number (Monday is the first day of the week) (range [00,53] ), leading zeroes permitted but not required tm_year , tm_wday , tm_yday OW parses the week of the year , as by %W , using the alternative numeric system, e.g. 五十二 parses as 52 in ja_JP locale tm_year , tm_wday , tm_yday Day of the year/month j parses day of the year as a decimal number (range [001,366] ), leading zeroes permitted but not required tm_yday d parses the day of the month as a decimal number (range [01,31] ), leading zeroes permitted but not required tm_mday Od parses the day of the month using the alternative numeric system, e.g. 二十七 parses as 27 in ja_JP locale, leading zeroes permitted but not required tm_mday e synonym of d tm_mday Oe synonym of Od tm_mday Day of the week a parses the name of the day of the week, either full or abbreviated, e.g. Fri tm_wday A synonym of a tm_wday w parses weekday as a decimal number, where Sunday is 0 (range [0-6] ) tm_wday Ow parses weekday as a decimal number, where Sunday is 0 , using the alternative numeric system, e.g. 二 parses as 2 in ja_JP locale tm_wday Hour, minute, second H parses the hour as a decimal number, 24 hour clock (range [00-23] ), leading zeroes permitted but not required tm_hour OH parses hour from 24-hour clock using the alternative numeric system, e.g. 十八 parses as 18 in ja_JP locale tm_hour I parses hour as a decimal number, 12 hour clock (range [01,12] ), leading zeroes permitted but not required tm_hour OI parses hour from 12-hour clock using the alternative numeric system, e.g. 六 reads as 06 in ja_JP locale tm_hour M parses minute as a decimal number (range [00,59] ), leading zeroes permitted but not required tm_min OM parses minute using the alternative numeric system, e.g. 二十五 parses as 25 in ja_JP locale tm_min S parses second as a decimal number (range [00,60] ), leading zeroes permitted but not required tm_sec OS parses second using the alternative numeric system, e.g. 二十四 parses as 24 in ja_JP locale tm_sec Other c parses the locale's standard date and time string format, e.g. Sun Oct 17 04:41:13 2010 (locale dependent) all Ec parses the locale's alternative date and time string format, e.g. expecting 平成23年 (year Heisei 23) instead of 2011年 (year 2011) in ja_JP locale all x parses the locale's standard date representation all Ex parses the locale's alternative date representation, e.g. expecting 平成23年 (year Heisei 23) instead of 2011年 (year 2011) in ja_JP locale all X parses the locale's standard time representation all EX parses the locale's alternative time representation all D equivalent to "%m / %d / %y " tm_mon , tm_mday , tm_year r parses locale's standard 12-hour clock time (in POSIX, "%I : %M : %S %p" ) tm_hour , tm_min , tm_sec R equivalent to "%H : %M" tm_hour , tm_min T equivalent to "%H : %M : %S" tm_hour , tm_min , tm_sec p parses the locale's equivalent of a.m. or p.m. tm_hour Note: tm_isdst is not written to, and needs to be set explicitly for use with functions such as mktime [ edit ] Return value An object of unspecified type such that if in is an object of type std:: basic_istream < CharT, Traits > , the expression in >> get_time ( tmb, fmt ) has type std:: basic_istream < CharT, Traits > & has value in behaves as if it called f ( in, tmb, fmt ) where the function f is defined as: template < class CharT, class Traits > void f ( std:: basic_ios < CharT, Traits > & str, std:: tm * tmb, const CharT * fmt ) { using Iter = std:: istreambuf_iterator < CharT, Traits > ; using TimeGet = time_get < CharT, Iter > ; std:: ios_base :: iostate err = std:: ios_base :: goodbit ; const TimeGet & tg = std:: use_facet < TimeGet > ( str. getloc ( ) ) ; tg. get ( Iter ( str. rdbuf ( ) ) , Iter ( ) , str, err, tmb, fmt, fmt + Traits :: length ( fmt ) ) ; if ( err ! = std:: ios_base :: goodbit ) str. setstate ( err ) ; } [ edit ] Notes As specified in std::time_get::do_get , which this function calls, it's unspecified if this function zero out the fields in * tmb that are not set directly by the conversion specifiers that appear in fmt : portable programs should initialize every field of * tmb to zero before calling std::get_time .
