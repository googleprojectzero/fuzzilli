It maintains several kinds of data: 1) state information: stream status flags. 2) control information: flags that control formatting of both input and output sequences and the imbued locale. 3) private storage: indexed extensible data structure that allows both long and void * members, which may be implemented as two arbitrary-length arrays or a single array of two-element structs or another container. 4) callbacks: arbitrary number of user-defined functions to be called from imbue() , std::basic_ios::copyfmt() , and ~ios_base() . Typical implementation holds member constants corresponding to all values of fmtflags , iostate , openmode , and seekdir shown below, member variables to maintain current precision, width, and formatting flags, the exception mask, the buffer error state, a resizeable container holding the callbacks, the currently imbued locale, the private storage, and a static integer variable for xalloc() .

DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior LWG 1357 ( N3110 ) C++98 std::ios_base defined operator~ , operator & and operator | for types openmode , fmtflags and iostate , violating the requirements of BitmaskType [1] removed these definitions ↑ A BitmaskType needs to support bitwise opertaions on its own. The bitwise operation support should not be provided externally.
