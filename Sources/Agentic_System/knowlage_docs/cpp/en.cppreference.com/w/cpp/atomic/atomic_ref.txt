C++20) The std::atomic_ref class template applies atomic operations to the object it references. For the lifetime of the std::atomic_ref object, the object it references is considered an atomic object. If one thread writes to an atomic object while another thread reads from it, the behavior is well-defined (see memory model for details on data races). In addition, accesses to atomic objects may establish inter-thread synchronization and order non-atomic memory accesses as specified by std::memory_order . The lifetime of an object must exceed the lifetime of all std::atomic_ref s that references the object. While any std::atomic_ref instance referencing an object exists, the object must be exclusively accessed through these std::atomic_ref instances. No subobject of an object referenced by an std::atomic_ref object may be concurrently referenced by any other std::atomic_ref object. Atomic operations applied to an object through an std::atomic_ref are atomic with respect to atomic operations applied through any other std::atomic_ref referencing the same object. Like references in the core language, constness is shallow for std::atomic_ref - it is possible to modify the referenced value through a const std::atomic_ref object. If any of the following conditions are satisfied, the program is ill-formed: std:: is_trivially_copyable_v < T > is false . is_always_lock_free is false and std:: is_volatile_v < T > is true . std::atomic_ref is CopyConstructible .

[ edit ] Notes Implementations may merge the specified specializations. E.g. MSVC STL merges all of them into the primary template. When T is cv void or a function type, std :: atomic_ref < T * > (i.e. std :: atomic_ref < void * > , std :: atomic_ref < int ( * ) ( ) > etc.) does not have difference_type or any operation requiring pointer arithmetic or relational comparison (since C++26) .
