Since many of regex operations are locale-sensitive (when std::regex_constants::collate flag is set), the regex_traits class typically holds an instance of a std::locale as a private member. [ edit ] Standard specializations Two specializations of std::regex_traits are defined by the standard library: std::regex_traits<char> std::regex_traits<wchar_t> These specializations make it possible to use std:: basic_regex < char > (aka std::regex ) and std:: basic_regex < wchar_t > (aka std::wregex ). To use std::basic_regex with other character types (for example, char32_t ), a user-provided trait class must be used. [ edit ] Member types Type Definition char_type CharT string_type std:: basic_string < CharT > locale_type The locale used for localized behavior in the regular expression. Must be CopyConstructible char_class_type Represents a character classification and is capable of holding an implementation specific set returned by lookup_classname . Must be a BitmaskType . [ edit ] Member functions (constructor) constructs the regex_traits object (public member function) [edit] length [static] calculates the length of a null-terminated character string (public static member function) [edit] translate determines the equivalence key for a character (public member function) [edit] translate_nocase determines the case-insensitive equivalence key for a character (public member function) [edit] transform determines the sort key for the given string, used to provide collation order (public member function) [edit] transform_primary determines the primary sort key for the character sequence, used to determine equivalence class (public member function) [edit] lookup_collatename gets a collation element by name (public member function) [edit] lookup_classname gets a character class by name (public member function) [edit] isctype indicates membership in a localized character class (public member function) [edit] value translates the character representing a numeric digit into an integral value (public member function) [edit] imbue sets the locale (public member function) [edit] getloc gets the locale (public member function) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/regex/regex_traits&oldid=167158 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages العربية Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 한국어 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 25 December 2023, at 08:15.
