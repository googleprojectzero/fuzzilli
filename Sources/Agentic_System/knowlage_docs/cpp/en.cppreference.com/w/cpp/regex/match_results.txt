This is a specialized allocator-aware container. It can only be default created, obtained from std::regex_iterator , or modified by std::regex_search or std::regex_match . Because std::match_results holds std::sub_match es, each of which is a pair of iterators into the original character sequence that was matched, it's undefined behavior to examine std::match_results if the original character sequence was destroyed or iterators to it were invalidated for other reasons. The first std::sub_match (index 0) contained in a std::match_result always represents the full match within a target sequence made by a regex, and subsequent std::sub_match es represent sub-expression matches corresponding in sequence to the left parenthesis delimiting the sub-expression in the regex. std::match_results meets the requirements of a AllocatorAwareContainer and of a SequenceContainer , except that only copy assignment, move assignment, and operations defined for a constant containers are supported, and that the semantics of comparison functions are different from those required for a container.
