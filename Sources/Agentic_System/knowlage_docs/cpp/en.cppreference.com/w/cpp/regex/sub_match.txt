A match is a [ begin , end ) pair within the target range matched by the regular expression, but with additional observer functions to enhance code clarity. Only the default constructor is publicly accessible. Instances of std::sub_match are normally constructed and populated as a part of a std::match_results container during the processing of one of the regex algorithms. The member functions return defined default values unless the matched member is true . std::sub_match inherits from std:: pair < BidirIt, BidirIt > , although it cannot be treated as a std::pair object because member functions such as assignment will not work as expected.
