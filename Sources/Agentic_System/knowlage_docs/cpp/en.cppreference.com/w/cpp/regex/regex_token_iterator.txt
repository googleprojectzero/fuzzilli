It can also be used to access the parts of the sequence that were not matched by the given regular expression (e.g. as a tokenizer). On construction, it constructs an std::regex_iterator and on every increment it steps through the requested sub-matches from the current match_results, incrementing the underlying std::regex_iterator when incrementing away from the last submatch. The default-constructed std::regex_token_iterator is the end-of-sequence iterator. When a valid std::regex_token_iterator is incremented after reaching the last submatch of the last match, it becomes equal to the end-of-sequence iterator. Dereferencing or incrementing it further invokes undefined behavior. Just before becoming the end-of-sequence iterator, a std::regex_token_iterator may become a suffix iterator , if the index - 1 (non-matched fragment) appears in the list of the requested submatch indices. Such iterator, if dereferenced, returns a match_results corresponding to the sequence of characters between the last match and the end of sequence. A typical implementation of std::regex_token_iterator holds the underlying std::regex_iterator , a container (e.g. std:: vector < int > ) of the requested submatch indices, the internal counter equal to the index of the submatch, a pointer to std::sub_match , pointing at the current submatch of the current match, and a std::match_results object containing the last non-matched character sequence (used in tokenizer mode).

Because the iterator stores a std::regex_iterator which stores a pointer to the regex, incrementing the iterator after the regex was destroyed results in undefined behavior. [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <algorithm> #include <fstream> #include <iostream> #include <iterator> #include <regex> int main ( ) { // Tokenization (non-matched fragments) // Note that regex is matched only two times; when the third value is obtained // the iterator is a suffix iterator. const std:: string text = "Quick brown fox." ; const std:: regex ws_re ( " \\ s+" ) ; // whitespace std:: copy ( std :: sregex_token_iterator ( text. begin ( ) , text. end ( ) , ws_re, - 1 ) , std :: sregex_token_iterator ( ) , std:: ostream_iterator < std:: string > ( std:: cout , " \n " ) ) ; std:: cout << ' \n ' ; // Iterating the first submatches const std:: string html = R "(<p><a href=" http : //google.com">google</a> )" R "(< a HREF =" http : //cppreference.com">cppreference</a>\n</p>)"; const std:: regex url_re ( R "!!(<\s*A\s+[^>]*href\s*=\s*" ( [ ^ "]*)" ) !!

DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior LWG 3698 ( P2770R0 ) C++20 regex_token_iterator was a forward_iterator while being a stashing iterator made input_iterator [1] ↑ iterator_category was unchanged by the resolution, because changing it to std::input_iterator_tag might break too much existing code.
