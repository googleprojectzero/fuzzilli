Several typedefs for common character types are provided: Defined in header <regex> Type Definition std::regex std :: basic_regex < char > std::wregex std :: basic_regex < wchar_t > Contents 1 Member types 2 Member functions 2.1 Observers 2.2 Locale 2.3 Modifiers 3 Constants 4 Non-member functions 5 Deduction guides (since C++17) [ edit ] Member types Member type Definition value_type CharT traits_type Traits string_type Traits::string_type locale_type Traits::locale_type flag_type std::regex_constants::syntax_option_type [ edit ] Member functions (constructor) constructs the regex object (public member function) [edit] (destructor) destructs the regex object (public member function) [edit] operator= assigns the contents (public member function) [edit] assign assigns the contents (public member function) [edit] Observers mark_count returns the number of marked sub-expressions within the regular expression (public member function) [edit] flags returns the syntax flags (public member function) [edit] Locale getloc get locale information (public member function) [edit] imbue set locale information (public member function) [edit] Modifiers swap swaps the contents (public member function) [edit] Constants Grammar option Effect(s) ECMAScript Use the Modified ECMAScript regular expression grammar . basic Use the basic POSIX regular expression grammar ( grammar documentation ). extended Use the extended POSIX regular expression grammar ( grammar documentation ). awk Use the regular expression grammar used by the awk utility in POSIX ( grammar documentation ). grep Use the regular expression grammar used by the grep utility in POSIX. This is effectively the same as the basic option with the addition of newline ' \n ' as an alternation separator. egrep Use the regular expression grammar used by the grep utility, with the -E option, in POSIX. This is effectively the same as the extended option with the addition of newline ' \n ' as an alternation separator in addition to '|' . Grammar variation Effect(s) icase Character matching should be performed without regard to case. nosubs When performing matches, all marked sub-expressions ( expr ) are treated as non-marking sub-expressions (?: expr ) . No matches are stored in the supplied std::regex_match structure and mark_count() is zero. optimize Instructs the regular expression engine to make matching faster, with the potential cost of making construction slower. For example, this might mean converting a non-deterministic FSA to a deterministic FSA. collate Character ranges of the form "[a-b]" will be locale sensitive. multiline (C++17) Specifies that ^ shall match the beginning of a line and $ shall match the end of a line, if the ECMAScript engine is selected. At most one grammar option can be chosen out of ECMAScript , basic , extended , awk , grep , egrep . If no grammar is chosen, ECMAScript is assumed to be selected. The other options serve as variations, such that std :: regex ( "meow" , std :: regex :: icase ) is equivalent to std :: regex ( "meow" , std :: regex :: ECMAScript | std :: regex :: icase ) . The member constants in basic_regex are duplicates of the syntax_option_type constants defined in the namespace std::regex_constants .
