It meets the requirements of a LegacyForwardIterator , except that for dereferenceable values a and b with a == b , * a and * b will not be bound to the same object. On construction, and on every increment, it calls std::regex_search and remembers the result (that is, saves a copy of the std:: match_results < BidirIt > value). The first object may be read when the iterator is constructed or when the first dereferencing is done. Otherwise, dereferencing only returns a copy of the most recently obtained regex match. The default-constructed std::regex_iterator is the end-of-sequence iterator. When a valid std::regex_iterator is incremented after reaching the last match ( std::regex_search returns false ), it becomes equal to the end-of-sequence iterator. Dereferencing or incrementing it further invokes undefined behavior. A typical implementation of std::regex_iterator holds the begin and the end iterators for the underlying sequence (two instances of BidirIt ), a pointer to the regular expression ( const regex_type * ), the match flags ( std::regex_constants::match_flag_type ), and the current match ( std:: match_results < BidirIt > ).

Because the iterator stores a pointer to the regex, incrementing the iterator after the regex was destroyed accesses a dangling pointer. If the part of the regular expression that matched is just an assertion ( ^ , $ , \b , \B ), the match stored in the iterator is a zero-length match, that is, match [ 0 ] . first == match [ 0 ] . second . [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <iostream> #include <iterator> #include <regex> #include <string> int main ( ) { const std:: string s = "Quick brown fox." ; std:: regex words_regex ( "[^ \\ s]+" ) ; auto words_begin = std :: sregex_iterator ( s. begin ( ) , s. end ( ) , words_regex ) ; auto words_end = std :: sregex_iterator ( ) ; std:: cout << "Found " << std:: distance ( words_begin, words_end ) << " words: \n " ; for ( std :: sregex_iterator i = words_begin ; i ! = words_end ; ++ i ) { std:: smatch match = * i ; std:: string match_str = match. str ( ) ; std:: cout << match_str << ' \n ' ; } } Output: Found 3 words: Quick brown fox. [ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards. DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior LWG 3698 ( P2770R0 ) C++20 regex_iterator was a forward_iterator while being a stashing iterator made input_iterator [1] ↑ iterator_category was unchanged by the resolution, because changing it to std::input_iterator_tag might break too much existing code.
