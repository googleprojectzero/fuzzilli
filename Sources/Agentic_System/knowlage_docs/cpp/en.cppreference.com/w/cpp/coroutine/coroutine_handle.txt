Every specialization of coroutine_handle is a LiteralType . 1) Primary template, can be created from the promise object of type Promise . 2) Specialization std :: coroutine_handle < void > erases the promise type. It is convertible from other specializations. 3) Specialization std :: coroutine_handle < std:: noop_coroutine_promise > refers to no-op coroutines. It cannot be created from a promise object. On typical implementations, every specialization of std::coroutine_handle is TriviallyCopyable . If the program adds specializations for std::coroutine_handle , the behavior is undefined.
