The standard I/O manipulator std::get_money uses the std::money_get facet of the I/O stream's locale. Inheritance diagram If a std::money_get specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its get() and do_get() are not guaranteed as specified. Contents 1 Specializations 2 Nested types 3 Data members 4 Member functions 5 Protected member functions 6 Example 7 Defect reports 8 See also [ edit ] Specializations The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object ): Defined in header <locale> std :: money_get < char > parses narrow string representations of monetary values std :: money_get < wchar_t > parses wide string representations of monetary values In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements: CharT is one of char , wchar_t , and any other implementation-defined character container type that meets the requirements for a character on which any of the iostream components can be instantiated; and InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator .

DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior LWG 427 C++98 money_get was guaranteed to accept any CharT that meets the requirements for a character on which any of the iostream components can be instantiated only guarantees to accept char , wchar_t and other implementation- defined character types LWG 2392 C++98 only character type CharT could be guaranteed to be accepted by money_get can guarantee to accept implementation- defined character container types [ edit ] See also moneypunct defines monetary formatting parameters used by std::money_get and std::money_put (class template) [edit] money_put formats a monetary value for output as a character sequence (class template) [edit] get_money (C++11) parses a monetary value (function template) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/locale/money_get&oldid=178032 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 26 November 2024, at 18:46.
