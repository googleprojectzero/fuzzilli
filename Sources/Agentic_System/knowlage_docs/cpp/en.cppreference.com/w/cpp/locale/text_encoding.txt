It is used to determine the ordinary character literal encoding of the translation environment at compile-time and the character encoding of the execution environment at runtime. Each text_encoding object encapsulates a character encoding scheme , uniquely identified by an enumerator in text_encoding::id and a corresponding name represented by a null-terminated byte string. These can be accessed through the mib() and name() member functions, respectively. The determination of whether an object represents a character encoding scheme implemented in the translation or execution environment is implementation-defined. The class text_encoding is a TriviallyCopyable type. The array object representing the corresponding name of the character encoding scheme is nested within the text_encoding object itself. The stored name is limited to a maximum of max_name_length characters excluding the null character ' \0 ' . The class supports both registered and non-registered character encodings. Registered encodings are those found in the IANA Character Sets Registry excluding the following character encodings: NATS-DANO (33) NATS-DANO-ADD (34). In addition, the class provides access for registered character encodings to: Primary name : The official name specified in the registry. Aliases : An implementation-defined superset of aliases from the registry. MIBenum value : A unique identifier for use in identifying coded character encodings. Non-registered encodings can be represented with an enumerator id :: other or id :: unknown and a custom name. A text_encoding object e whose MIBenum value is neither id :: other nor id :: unknown maintains the following invariants: * e. name ( ) ! = ' \0 ' is true , and e. mib ( ) == std:: text_encoding ( e. name ( ) ) . mib ( ) is true .

For convenience, the enumerators of text_encoding::id are introduced as members of text_encoding and can be accessed directly. This means that text_encoding :: ASCII and text_encoding :: id :: ASCII refer to the same entity. It is recommended that the implementation should treat registered encodings as not interchangeable. Additionally, the primary name of a registered encoding should not be used to describe a similar but different non-registered encoding, unless there is a clear precedent for doing so.
