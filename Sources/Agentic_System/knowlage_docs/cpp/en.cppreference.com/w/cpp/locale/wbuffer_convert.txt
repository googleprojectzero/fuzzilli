All I/O performed through std::wbuffer_convert undergoes character conversion as defined by the facet Codecvt . std::wbuffer_convert assumes ownership of the conversion facet, and cannot use a facet managed by a locale. The standard facets suitable for use with std::wbuffer_convert are std::codecvt_utf8 for UTF-8/UCS-2 and UTF-8/UCS-4 conversions and std::codecvt_utf8_utf16 for UTF-8/UTF-16 conversions. This class template makes the implicit character conversion functionality of std::basic_filebuf available for any std::basic_streambuf .
