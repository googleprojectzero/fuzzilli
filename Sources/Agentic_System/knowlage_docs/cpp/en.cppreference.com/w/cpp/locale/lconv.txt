Objects of this struct may be obtained with std::localeconv . The members of std::lconv are values of type char and of type char * . Each char * member except decimal_point may be pointing at a null character (that is, at an empty C-string). The members of type char are all non-negative numbers, any of which may be CHAR_MAX if the corresponding value is not available in the current C locale. Contents 1 Member objects 1.1 Non-monetary numeric formatting parameters 1.2 Monetary numeric formatting parameters 1.3 Local monetary numeric formatting parameters 1.4 International monetary numeric formatting parameters 2 Example 3 See also [ edit ] Member objects [ edit ] Non-monetary numeric formatting parameters char* decimal_point the character used as the decimal point (public member object) char* thousands_sep the character used to separate groups of digits before the decimal point (public member object) char* grouping a string whose elements indicate the sizes of digit groups (public member object) [ edit ] Monetary numeric formatting parameters char* mon_decimal_point the character used as the decimal point (public member object) char* mon_thousands_sep the character used to separate groups of digits before the decimal point (public member object) char* mon_grouping a string whose elements indicate the sizes of digit groups (public member object) char* positive_sign a string used to indicate non-negative monetary quantity (public member object) char* negative_sign a string used to indicate negative monetary quantity (public member object) [ edit ] Local monetary numeric formatting parameters char* currency_symbol the symbol used for currency in the current C locale (public member object) char frac_digits the number of digits after the decimal point to display in a monetary quantity (public member object) char p_cs_precedes 1 if currency_symbol is placed before non-negative value, ​ 0 ​ if after (public member object) char n_cs_precedes 1 if currency_symbol is placed before negative value, ​ 0 ​ if after (public member object) char p_sep_by_space indicates the separation of currency_symbol , positive_sign , and the non-negative monetary value (public member object) char n_sep_by_space indicates the separation of currency_symbol , negative_sign , and the negative monetary value (public member object) char p_sign_posn indicates the position of positive_sign in a non-negative monetary value (public member object) char n_sign_posn indicates the position of negative_sign in a negative monetary value (public member object) [ edit ] International monetary numeric formatting parameters char* int_curr_symbol the string used as international currency name in the current C locale (public member object) char int_frac_digits the number of digits after the decimal point to display in an international monetary quantity (public member object) char int_p_cs_precedes (C++11) 1 if int_curr_symbol is placed before non-negative international monetary value, ​ 0 ​ if after (public member object) char int_n_cs_precedes (C++11) 1 if int_curr_symboll is placed before negative international monetary value, ​ 0 ​ if after (public member object) char int_p_sep_by_space (C++11) indicates the separation of int_curr_symbol , positive_sign , and the non-negative international monetary value (public member object) char int_n_sep_by_space (C++11) indicates the separation of int_curr_symbol , negative_sign , and the negative international monetary value (public member object) char int_p_sign_posn (C++11) indicates the position of positive_sign in a non-negative international monetary value (public member object) char int_n_sign_posn (C++11) indicates the position of negative_sign in a negative international monetary value (public member object) The characters of the C-strings pointed to by grouping and mon_grouping are interpreted according to their numeric values. When the terminating ' \0 ' is encountered, the last value seen is assumed to repeat for the remainder of digits. If CHAR_MAX is encountered, no further digits are grouped. the typical grouping of three digits at a time is " \003 " . The values of p_sep_by_space , n_sep_by_space , int_p_sep_by_space , int_n_sep_by_space are interpreted as follows: 0 no space separates the currency symbol and the value 1 sign sticks to the currency symbol, value is separated by a space 2 sign sticks to the value. Currency symbol is separated by a space The values of p_sign_posn , n_sign_posn , int_p_sign_posn , int_n_sign_posn are interpreted as follows: 0 parentheses around the value and the currency symbol are used to represent the sign 1 sign before the value and the currency symbol 2 sign after the value and the currency symbol 3 sign before the currency symbol 4 sign after the currency symbol [ edit ] Example [edit] Run this code #include <clocale> #include <iostream> int main ( ) { std:: setlocale ( LC_ALL , "ja_JP.UTF-8" ) ; std :: lconv * lc = std:: localeconv ( ) ; std:: cout << "Japanese currency symbol: " << lc - > currency_symbol << '(' << lc - > int_curr_symbol << ") \n " ; } Output: Japanese currency symbol: ￥(JPY ) [ edit ] See also localeconv queries numeric and monetary formatting details of the current locale (function) [edit] numpunct defines numeric punctuation rules (class template) [edit] moneypunct defines monetary formatting parameters used by std::money_get and std::money_put (class template) [edit] C documentation for lconv Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/locale/lconv&oldid=96330 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 22 October 2017, at 01:38.
