[ edit ] Semantic requirements If T is an object type, then move_constructible<T> is modeled only if given rv , an rvalue of type T , and u2 , a distinct object of type T equal to rv , the following are true: After the definition T u = rv ; , u is equal to u2 ; T(rv) is equal to u2 ; and If T is not const-qualified, then rv 's resulting state (after the definition/expression is evaluated in either bullets above) is valid but unspecified; otherwise, it is unchanged.
