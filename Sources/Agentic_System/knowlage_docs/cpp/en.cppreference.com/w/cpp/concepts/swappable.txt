The concept swappable_with<T, U> specifies that expressions of the type and value category encoded by T and U are swappable with each other. swappable_with<T, U> is satisfied only if a call to ranges:: swap ( t, u ) exchanges the value of t and u , that is, given distinct objects t2 equal to t and u2 equal to u , after evaluating either ranges:: swap ( t, u ) or ranges:: swap ( u, t ) , t2 is equal to u and u2 is equal to t . [ edit ] Equality preservation Expressions declared in requires expressions of the standard library concepts are required to be equality-preserving (except where stated otherwise).
