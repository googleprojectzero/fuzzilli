Comparing mixed operands yields results equivalent to comparing the operands converted to their common type. 3) The exposition-only concept __PartiallyOrderedWith specifies that a value of type T and a value of type U can be compared in a partial order with each other (in either order) using < , > , <= , and >= , and the results of the comparisons are consistent. Contents 1 Semantic requirements 2 Equality preservation 3 Implicit expression variations 4 References 5 See also [ edit ] Semantic requirements These concepts are modeled only if they are satisfied and all concepts they subsume are modeled. 1) std :: totally_ordered < T > is modeled only if, given lvalues a , b and c of type const std:: remove_reference_t < T > : Exactly one of bool ( a < b ) , bool ( a > b ) and bool ( a == b ) is true ; If bool ( a < b ) and bool ( b < c ) are both true , then bool ( a < c ) is true ; bool ( a > b ) == bool ( b < a ) bool ( a >= b ) == ! bool ( a < b ) bool ( a <= b ) == ! bool ( b < a ) 2) std :: totally_ordered_with < T, U > is modeled only if, given t and t2 , lvalues denoting distinct equal objects of types const std:: remove_reference_t < T > and std:: remove_reference_t < T > respectively, and u and u2 , lvalues denoting distinct equal objects of types const std:: remove_reference_t < U > and std:: remove_reference_t < U > respectively, let C be std:: common_reference_t < const std:: remove_reference_t < T > & , const std:: remove_reference_t < U > & > , and, given an expression E and a type C , let CONVERT_TO < C > ( E ) be: static_cast < C > ( std:: as_const ( E ) ) . (until C++23) static_cast < const C & > ( std:: as_const ( E ) ) if that is a valid expression, static_cast < const C & > ( std :: move ( E ) ) otherwise. (since C++23) the following are true: bool ( t < u ) == bool ( CONVERT_TO < C > ( t2 ) < CONVERT_TO < C > ( u2 ) ) bool ( t > u ) == bool ( CONVERT_TO < C > ( t2 ) > CONVERT_TO < C > ( u2 ) ) bool ( t <= u ) == bool ( CONVERT_TO < C > ( t2 ) <= CONVERT_TO < C > ( u2 ) ) bool ( t >= u ) == bool ( CONVERT_TO < C > ( t2 ) >= CONVERT_TO < C > ( u2 ) ) bool ( u < t ) == bool ( CONVERT_TO < C > ( u2 ) < CONVERT_TO < C > ( t2 ) ) bool ( u > t ) == bool ( CONVERT_TO < C > ( u2 ) > CONVERT_TO < C > ( t2 ) ) bool ( u <= t ) == bool ( CONVERT_TO < C > ( u2 ) <= CONVERT_TO < C > ( t2 ) ) bool ( u >= t ) == bool ( CONVERT_TO < C > ( u2 ) >= CONVERT_TO < C > ( t2 ) ) 3) __PartiallyOrderedWith < T, U > is modeled only if given any lvalue t of type const std:: remove_reference_t < T > , and any lvalue u of type const std:: remove_reference_t < U > , the following are true: t < u , t <= u , t > u , t >= u , u < t , u <= t , u > t , and u >= t have the same domain; bool ( t < u ) == bool ( u > t ) ; bool ( u < t ) == bool ( t > u ) ; bool ( t <= u ) == bool ( u >= t ) ; and bool ( u <= t ) == bool ( t >= u ) . [ edit ] Equality preservation Expressions declared in requires expressions of the standard library concepts are required to be equality-preserving (except where stated otherwise). [ edit ] Implicit expression variations A requires expression that uses an expression that is non-modifying for some constant lvalue operand also requires implicit expression variations .
