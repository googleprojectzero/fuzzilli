Comparing mixed operands yields results equivalent to comparing the operands converted to their common type. 3) The exposition-only concept __WeaklyEqualityComparableWith specifies that an object of type T and an object of type U can be compared for equality with each other (in either order) using both == and != , and the results of the comparisons are consistent. 4) The exposition-only concept __ComparisonCommonTypeWith specifies that two types share a common type, and a const lvalue or a non-const rvalue (since C++23) of either type is convertible to that common type. Contents 1 Semantic requirements 2 Equality preservation 3 Implicit expression variations 4 References [ edit ] Semantic requirements These concepts are modeled only if they are satisfied and all concepts they subsume are modeled. In the following paragraphs, given an expression E and a type C , CONVERT_TO < C > ( E ) is defined as: static_cast < C > ( std:: as_const ( E ) ) . (until C++23) static_cast < const C & > ( std:: as_const ( E ) ) if that is a valid expression, static_cast < const C & > ( std :: move ( E ) ) otherwise. (since C++23) 1) std :: equality_comparable < T > is modeled only if, given objects a and b of type T , bool ( a == b ) is true if and only if a and b are equal. Together with the requirement that a == b is equality-preserving , this implies that == is symmetric and transitive, and further that == is reflexive for all objects a that are equal to at least one other object. 2) std :: equality_comparable_with < T, U > is modeled only if, let t and t2 be lvalues denoting distinct equal objects of types const std:: remove_reference_t < T > and std:: remove_cvref_t < T > respectively, u and u2 be lvalues denoting distinct equal objects of types const std:: remove_reference_t < U > and std:: remove_cvref_t < U > respectively, C be std:: common_reference_t < const std:: remove_reference_t < T > & , const std:: remove_reference_t < U > & > , the following expression is true: bool ( t == u ) == bool ( CONVERT_TO < C > ( t2 ) == CONVERT_TO < C > ( u2 ) ) . 3) __WeaklyEqualityComparableWith < T, U > is modeled only if given t , an lvalue of type const std:: remove_reference_t < T > and u , an lvalue of type const std:: remove_reference_t < U > , the following are true: t == u , u == t , t ! = u , u ! = t have the same domain; bool ( u == t ) == bool ( t == u ) ; bool ( t ! = u ) == ! bool ( t == u ) ; and bool ( u ! = t ) == bool ( t ! = u ) . 4) __WeaklyEqualityComparableWith < T, U > is modeled only if: The corresponding common_reference_with concept is modeled. (until C++23) Let C be std:: common_reference_t < const T & , const U & > , t1 and t2 be equality-preserving expressions that are lvalues of type std:: remove_cvref_t < T > , u1 and u2 be equality-preserving expressions that are lvalues of type std:: remove_cvref_t < U > , the following conditions hold: CONVERT_TO < C > ( t1 ) equals CONVERT_TO < C > ( t2 ) if and only if t1 equals t2 ; and CONVERT_TO < C > ( u1 ) equals CONVERT_TO < C > ( u2 ) if and only if u1 equals u2 . (since C++23) [ edit ] Equality preservation Expressions declared in requires expressions of the standard library concepts are required to be equality-preserving (except where stated otherwise). [ edit ] Implicit expression variations A requires expression that uses an expression that is non-modifying for some constant lvalue operand also requires implicit expression variations .
