Write permissions are required to both the directory that contains old_p and the directory that contains new_p . non-existing file in an existing directory: The pathname new_p is linked to the file and old_p is unlinked from the file. Write permissions are required to both the directory that contains old_p and the directory that contains new_p . If old_p is a directory, then new_p must be one of: the same directory as old_p or a hardlink to it: nothing is done in this case. existing directory: new_p is deleted if empty on POSIX systems, but this may be an error on other systems. If not an error, then new_p is first deleted, then, without allowing other processes to observe new_p as deleted, the pathname new_p is linked to the directory and old_p is unlinked from the directory. Write permissions are required to both the directory that contains old_p and the directory that contains new_p . non-existing directory, not ending with a directory separator, and whose parent directory exists: The pathname new_p is linked to the directory and old_p is unlinked from the directory. Write permissions are required to both the directory that contains old_p and the directory that contains new_p . Symlinks are not followed: if old_p is a symlink, it is itself renamed, not its target. If new_p is an existing symlink, it is itself erased, not its target. Rename fails if new_p ends with dot or with dot-dot . new_p names a non-existing directory ending with a directory separator. old_p is a directory which is an ancestor of new_p .
