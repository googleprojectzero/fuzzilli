If p is not an absolute path, the function behaves as if it is first made absolute by std:: filesystem :: absolute ( p ) . The path p must exist. 3,4) Returns a path composed by operator / = from the result of calling canonical() with a path argument composed of the leading elements of p that exist (as determined by status ( p ) or status ( p, ec ) ), if any, followed by the elements of p that do not exist. The resulting path is in normal form . Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Exceptions 4 Notes 5 Example 6 Defect reports 7 See also [ edit ] Parameters p - a path which may be absolute or relative; for canonical it must be an existing path ec - error code to store error status to [ edit ] Return value 1,2) An absolute path that resolves to the same file as std:: filesystem :: absolute ( p ) . 3,4) A normal path of the form canonical ( x ) / y , where x is a path composed of the longest leading sequence of elements in p that exist, and y is a path composed of the remaining trailing non-existent elements of p . [ edit ] Exceptions Any overload not marked noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails. 1,3) Throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first path argument and the OS error code as the error code argument. 2,4) Sets a std:: error_code & parameter to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec. clear ( ) if no errors occur. [ edit ] Notes The function canonical() is modeled after the POSIX realpath . The function weakly_canonical() was introduced to simplify operational semantics of relative() .
