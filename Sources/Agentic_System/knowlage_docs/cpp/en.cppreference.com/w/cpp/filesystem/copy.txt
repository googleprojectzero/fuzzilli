The behavior is undefined if there is more than one option in any of the copy_options option group present in options (even in the copy_file group). The behavior is as follows: First, before doing anything else, obtains type and permissions of from by no more than a single call to std::filesystem::symlink_status , if copy_options::skip_symlinks , copy_options::copy_symlinks , or copy_options::create_symlinks is present in options ; std::filesystem::status otherwise. If necessary, obtains the status of to , by no more than a single call to std::filesystem::symlink_status , if copy_options::skip_symlinks or copy_options::create_symlinks is present in options ; std::filesystem::status otherwise (including the case where copy_options::copy_symlinks is present in options ). If either from or to has an implementation-defined file type , the effects of this function are implementation-defined. If from does not exist, reports an error. If from and to are the same file as determined by std::filesystem::equivalent , reports an error. If either from or to is not a regular file, a directory, or a symlink, as determined by std::filesystem::is_other , reports an error. If from is a directory, but to is a regular file, reports an error. If from is a symbolic link, then If copy_options::skip_symlink is present in options , does nothing. Otherwise, if to does not exist and copy_options::copy_symlinks is present in options , then behaves as if copy_symlink ( from, to ) . Otherwise, reports an error. Otherwise, if from is a regular file, then If copy_options::directories_only is present in options , does nothing. Otherwise, if copy_options::create_symlinks is present in options , creates a symlink to to . Note: from must be an absolute path unless to is in the current directory. Otherwise, if copy_options::create_hard_links is present in options , creates a hard link to to . Otherwise, if to is a directory, then behaves as if copy_file ( from, to / from. filename ( ) , options ) (creates a copy of from as a file in the directory to ). Otherwise, behaves as if copy_file ( from, to, options ) (copies the file). Otherwise, if from is a directory and copy_options::create_symlinks is set in options , reports an error with an error code equal to std:: make_error_code ( std:: errc :: is_a_directory ) . Otherwise, if from is a directory and either options has copy_options::recursive or is copy_options::none , If to does not exist, first executes create_directory ( to, from ) (creates the new directory with a copy of the old directory's attributes). Then, whether to already existed or was just created, iterates over the files contained in from as if by for ( const std:: filesystem :: directory_entry & x : std:: filesystem :: directory_iterator ( from ) ) and for each directory entry, recursively calls copy ( x. path ( ) , to / x. path ( ) . filename ( ) , options | in - recursive - copy ) , where in-recursive-copy is a special bit that has no other effect when set in options . (The sole purpose of setting this bit is to prevent recursive copying subdirectories if options is copy_options::none .) Otherwise does nothing.

[ edit ] Notes The default behavior when copying directories is the non-recursive copy: the files are copied, but not the subdirectories: // Given // /dir1 contains /dir1/file1, /dir1/file2, /dir1/dir2 // and /dir1/dir2 contains /dir1/dir2/file3 // After std :: filesystem :: copy ( "/dir1" , "/dir3" ) ; // /dir3 is created (with the attributes of /dir1) // /dir1/file1 is copied to /dir3/file1 // /dir1/file2 is copied to /dir3/file2 While with copy_options::recursive , the subdirectories are also copied, with their content, recursively. // ...but after std :: filesystem :: copy ( "/dir1" , "/dir3" , std:: filesystem :: copy_options :: recursive ) ; // /dir3 is created (with the attributes of /dir1) // /dir1/file1 is copied to /dir3/file1 // /dir1/file2 is copied to /dir3/file2 // /dir3/dir2 is created (with the attributes of /dir1/dir2) // /dir1/dir2/file3 is copied to /dir3/dir2/file3 [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <cstdlib> #include <filesystem> #include <fstream> #include <iostream> namespace fs = std :: filesystem ; int main ( ) { fs :: create_directories ( "sandbox/dir/subdir" ) ; std:: ofstream ( "sandbox/file1.txt" ) . put ( 'a' ) ; fs :: copy ( "sandbox/file1.txt" , "sandbox/file2.txt" ) ; // copy file fs :: copy ( "sandbox/dir" , "sandbox/dir2" ) ; // copy directory (non-recursive) const auto copyOptions = fs :: copy_options :: update_existing | fs :: copy_options :: recursive | fs :: copy_options :: directories_only ; fs :: copy ( "sandbox" , "sandbox_copy" , copyOptions ) ; static_cast < void > ( std:: system ( "tree" ) ) ; fs :: remove_all ( "sandbox" ) ; fs :: remove_all ( "sandbox_copy" ) ; } Possible output: . ├── sandbox │ ├── dir │ │ └── subdir │ ├── dir2 │ ├── file1.txt │ └── file2.txt └── sandbox_copy ├── dir │ └── subdir └── dir2 8 directories, 2 files [ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
