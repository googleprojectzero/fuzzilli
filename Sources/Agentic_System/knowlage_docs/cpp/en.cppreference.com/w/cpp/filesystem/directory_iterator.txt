The iteration order is unspecified, except that each directory entry is visited only once. The special pathnames dot and dot-dot are skipped. If the directory_iterator reports an error or is advanced past the last directory entry, it becomes equal to the default-constructed iterator, also known as the end iterator. Two end iterators are always equal, dereferencing or incrementing the end iterator is undefined behavior. If a file or a directory is deleted or added to the directory tree after the directory iterator has been created, it is unspecified whether the change would be observed through the iterator.

It is unspecified whether operator!= is provided because it can be synthesized from operator== , and (since C++20) whether an equality operator is a member or non-member. [ edit ] Helper specializations template <> constexpr bool ranges:: enable_borrowed_range < std :: filesystem :: directory_iterator > = true ; (since C++20) template <> constexpr bool ranges:: enable_view < std :: filesystem :: directory_iterator > = true ; (since C++20) These specializations for directory_iterator make it a borrowed_range and a view . [ edit ] Notes Many low-level OS APIs for directory traversal retrieve file attributes along with the next directory entry. The constructors and the non-const member functions of std::filesystem::directory_iterator store these attributes, if any, in the pointed-to std::filesystem::directory_entry without calling directory_entry::refresh , which makes it possible to examine the attributes of the directory entries as they are being iterated over, without making additional system calls.
