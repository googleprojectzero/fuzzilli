When inserted into a program, they are effectively ignored by the compiler; they are solely intended to be used as notes by the humans that read source code. Although specific documentation is not part of the C++ standard, several utilities exist that parse comments with different documentation formats. Contents 1 Syntax 2 C-style 3 C++-style 4 Notes 5 Example 6 See also [ edit ] Syntax /* comment */ (1) // comment (2) 1) Often known as "C-style" or "multi-line" comments. 2) Often known as "C++-style" or "single-line" comments. All comments are removed from the program at translation phase 3 by replacing each comment with a single whitespace character. [ edit ] C-style C-style comments are usually used to comment large blocks of text, however, they can be used to comment single lines. To insert a C-style comment, simply surround text with /* and */ ; this will cause the contents of the comment to be ignored by the compiler. Although it is not part of the C++ standard, /** and */ are often used to indicate documentation blocks; this is legal because the second asterisk is simply treated as part of the comment. C-style comments cannot be nested. [ edit ] C++-style C++-style comments are usually used to comment single lines, however, multiple C++-style comments can be placed together to form multi-line comments. C++-style comments tell the compiler to ignore all content between // and a new line. [ edit ] Notes Because comments are removed before the preprocessor stage, a macro cannot be used to form a comment and an unterminated C-style comment doesn't spill over from an #include'd file. Besides commenting out, other mechanisms used for source code exclusion are #if 0 std:: cout << "this will not be executed or even compiled \n " ; #endif and if ( false ) { std:: cout << "this will not be executed \n " ; } [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <iostream> /* C-style comments can contain multiple lines */ /* or just one */ /************** * you can insert any *, but * you can't make comments nested */ // C++-style comments can comment one line // or, they can // be strung together int main ( ) { // comments are removed before preprocessing, // so ABC is "1", not "1//2134", and "1 hello world" // will be printed #define ABC 1//2134 std:: cout << ABC << " hello world \n " ; // The below code won't be run // return 1; // The below code will be run return 0 ; } Output: 1 hello world [ edit ] See also C documentation for comment Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/comment&oldid=172112 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 한국어 Polski Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 28 May 2024, at 07:35.
