This means the type is compatible with the types used in the C programming language, that is, can be exchanged with C libraries directly, in its binary form. Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency. This type requirement is deprecated in the C++ standard. All of its uses have been replaced by the more refined type requirements, such as TrivialType , ScalarType , or StandardLayoutType . (since C++20) [ edit ] Requirements The following types are collectively called POD types : scalar types POD classes arrays of such types cv-qualified versions of these types [ edit ] See also is_pod (C++11) (deprecated in C++20) checks if a type is a plain-old data (POD) type (class template) [edit] is_scalar (C++11) checks if a type is a scalar type (class template) [edit] is_trivial (C++11) (deprecated in C++26) checks if a type is trivial (class template) [edit] is_standard_layout (C++11) checks if a type is a standard-layout type (class template) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/named_req/PODType&oldid=145717 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 19 December 2022, at 15:30.
