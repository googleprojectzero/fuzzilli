Standard layout types are useful for communicating with code written in other programming languages. Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency. Contents 1 Requirements 2 Properties 3 Defect reports 4 See also [ edit ] Requirements The following types are collectively called standard-layout types : scalar types standard-layout class types arrays of such types cv-qualified versions of these types [ edit ] Properties See Standard-layout . [ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards. DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior CWG 1672 C++11 first non-static data member rule ignored existence of empty base classes first non-static data member rule made recursive CWG 1813 C++11 class with a member defined in an indirect base wasn't technically standard-layout all member declarations must be in the same class CWG 2120 C++11 array as first member wasn't considered when comparing the first element type with type of a base array members are considered [ edit ] See also is_standard_layout (C++11) checks if a type is a standard-layout type (class template) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/named_req/StandardLayoutType&oldid=168783 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 19 January 2024, at 06:06.
