This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency. Contents 1 Requirements 2 Notes 3 Defect reports 4 See also [ edit ] Requirements The following types are collectively called trivially copyable types : scalar types trivially copyable class types arrays of such types cv-qualified versions of these types [ edit ] Notes In general, for any trivially copyable type T and an object obj1 of T , the underlying bytes of obj1 can be copied into an array of char , or unsigned char , or std::byte (since C++17) or into obj2 , a distinct object of T . Neither obj1 nor obj2 may be a potentially-overlapping subobject. If the underlying bytes of obj1 are copied into such an array, and then the resulting content is copied back into obj1 , obj1 will hold its original value. If the underlying bytes of obj1 are copied into obj2 , obj2 will hold obj1 's value. Underlying bytes can be copied by std::memcpy or std::memmove , as long as no living volatile object is accessed.
