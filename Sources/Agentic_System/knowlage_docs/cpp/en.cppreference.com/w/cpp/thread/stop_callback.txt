Callback functions registered via stop_callback 's constructor are invoked either in the same thread that successfully invokes request_stop ( ) for a std::stop_source of the stop_callback 's associated std::stop_token ; or if stop has already been requested prior to the constructor's registration, then the callback is invoked in the thread constructing the stop_callback . More than one stop_callback can be created for the same std::stop_token , from the same or different threads concurrently. No guarantee is provided for the order in which they will be executed, but they will be invoked synchronously; except for stop_callback (s) constructed after stop has already been requested for the std::stop_token , as described previously. If an invocation of a callback exits via an exception then std::terminate is called. std::stop_callback is not CopyConstructible , CopyAssignable , MoveConstructible , nor MoveAssignable . The template param Callback type must be both invocable and destructible . Any return value is ignored.
