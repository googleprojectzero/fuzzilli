Args > void call_once ( std:: once_flag & flag, Callable && f, Args && ... args ) ; (since C++11) Executes the Callable object f exactly once, even if called concurrently from several threads. In detail: If, by the time std::call_once is called, flag indicates that f was already called, std::call_once returns right away (such a call to std::call_once is known as passive ). Otherwise, std::call_once calls INVOKE ( std:: forward < Callable > ( f ) , std:: forward < Args > ( args ) ... ) . Unlike the std::thread constructor or std::async , the arguments are not moved or copied because they do not need to be transferred to another thread of execution (such a call to std::call_once is known as active ). If that invocation throws an exception, it is propagated to the caller of std::call_once , and flag is not flipped so that another call will be attempted (such a call to std::call_once is known as exceptional ﻿). If that invocation returns normally (such a call to std::call_once is known as returning ), flag is flipped, and all other calls to std::call_once with the same flag are guaranteed to be passive . All active calls on the same flag form a single total order consisting of zero or more exceptional calls, followed by one returning call. The end of each active call synchronizes-with the next active call in that order. The return from the returning call synchronizes-with the returns from all passive calls on the same flag : this means that all concurrent calls to std::call_once are guaranteed to observe any side-effects made by the active call, with no additional synchronization. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Exceptions 4 Notes 5 Example 6 Defect reports 7 See also [ edit ] Parameters flag - an object, for which exactly one function gets executed f - Callable object to invoke args... - arguments to pass to the function [ edit ] Return value (none) [ edit ] Exceptions std::system_error if any condition prevents calls to std::call_once from executing as specified. Any exception thrown by f . [ edit ] Notes If concurrent calls to std::call_once pass different functions f , it is unspecified which f will be called. The selected function runs in the same thread as the std::call_once invocation it was passed to. Initialization of function-local statics is guaranteed to occur only once even when called from multiple threads, and may be more efficient than the equivalent code using std::call_once . The POSIX equivalent of this function is pthread_once . [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <iostream> #include <mutex> #include <thread> std:: once_flag flag1, flag2 ; void simple_do_once ( ) { std :: call_once ( flag1, [ ] ( ) { std:: cout << "Simple example: called once \n " ; } ) ; } void may_throw_function ( bool do_throw ) { if ( do_throw ) { std:: cout << "Throw: call_once will retry \n " ; // this may appear more than once throw std:: exception ( ) ; } std:: cout << "Did not throw, call_once will not attempt again \n " ; // guaranteed once } void do_once ( bool do_throw ) { try { std :: call_once ( flag2, may_throw_function, do_throw ) ; } catch ( ... ) { } } int main ( ) { std:: thread st1 ( simple_do_once ) ; std:: thread st2 ( simple_do_once ) ; std:: thread st3 ( simple_do_once ) ; std:: thread st4 ( simple_do_once ) ; st1. join ( ) ; st2. join ( ) ; st3. join ( ) ; st4. join ( ) ; std:: thread t1 ( do_once, true ) ; std:: thread t2 ( do_once, true ) ; std:: thread t3 ( do_once, false ) ; std:: thread t4 ( do_once, true ) ; t1. join ( ) ; t2. join ( ) ; t3. join ( ) ; t4. join ( ) ; } Possible output: Simple example: called once Throw: call_once will retry Throw: call_once will retry Throw: call_once will retry Did not throw, call_once will not attempt again [ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
