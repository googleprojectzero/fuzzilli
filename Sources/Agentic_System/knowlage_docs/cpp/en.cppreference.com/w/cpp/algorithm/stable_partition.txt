Relative order of the elements is preserved. 2) Same as (1) , but executed according to policy . This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied: std:: is_execution_policy_v < std:: decay_t < ExecutionPolicy >> is true . (until C++20) std:: is_execution_policy_v < std:: remove_cvref_t < ExecutionPolicy >> is true . (since C++20) If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined: The type of * first is not Swappable . (until C++11) BidirIt is not ValueSwappable . The type of * first is not MoveConstructible . The type of * first is not MoveAssignable . (since C++11) Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Complexity 4 Exceptions 5 Notes 6 Example 7 Defect reports 8 See also [ edit ] Parameters first, last - the pair of iterators defining the range of elements to reorder policy - the execution policy to use p - unary predicate which returns ​ true if the element should be ordered before other elements. The expression p ( v ) must be convertible to bool for every argument v of type (possibly const) VT , where VT is the value type of BidirIt , regardless of value category , and must not modify v . Thus, a parameter type of VT & is not allowed , nor is VT unless for VT a move is equivalent to a copy (since C++11) . ​ Type requirements - BidirIt must meet the requirements of LegacyBidirectionalIterator . - UnaryPred must meet the requirements of Predicate . [ edit ] Return value Iterator to the first element of the second group. [ edit ] Complexity Given \(\scriptsize N\) N as std:: distance ( first, last ) : 1) Exactly \(\scriptsize N\) N applications of p . \(\scriptsize O(N)\) O(N) swaps if there is enough extra memory, otherwise at most \(\scriptsize N \cdot log_{2}(N)\) N⋅log 2 (N) swaps. 2) \(\scriptsize O(N)\) O(N) applications of p . \(\scriptsize N \cdot log(N)\) N⋅log(N) swaps. [ edit ] Exceptions The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as follows: If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies , std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy , the behavior is implementation-defined. If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown. [ edit ] Notes This function attempts to allocate a temporary buffer. If the allocation fails, the less efficient algorithm is chosen. Implementations in libc++ and libstdc++ also accept ranges denoted by LegacyForwardIterator s as an extension.
