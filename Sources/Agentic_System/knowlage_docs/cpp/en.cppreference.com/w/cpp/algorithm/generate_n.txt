Does nothing otherwise. 2) Same as (1) , but executed according to policy . This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied: std:: is_execution_policy_v < std:: decay_t < ExecutionPolicy >> is true . (until C++20) std:: is_execution_policy_v < std:: remove_cvref_t < ExecutionPolicy >> is true . (since C++20) If Size is not convertible to an integral type , the program is ill-formed. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Complexity 4 Exceptions 5 Possible implementation 6 Example 7 Defect reports 8 See also [ edit ] Parameters first - the beginning of the range of elements to generate count - number of the elements to generate policy - the execution policy to use g - generator function object that will be called. The signature of the function should be equivalent to the following: Ret fun ( ) ; The type Ret must be such that an object of type OutputIt can be dereferenced and assigned a value of type Ret . ​ Type requirements - OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator . - ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator . [ edit ] Return value Iterator one past the last element assigned if count > 0 , first otherwise. [ edit ] Complexity Exactly std:: max ( 0 , count ) invocations of g ( ) and assignments. [ edit ] Exceptions The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as follows: If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies , std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy , the behavior is implementation-defined. If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown. [ edit ] Possible implementation template < class OutputIt, class Size, class Generator > constexpr // since C++20 OutputIt generate_n ( OutputIt first, Size count, Generator g ) { for ( Size i = 0 ; i < count ; ++ i, ++ first ) * first = g ( ) ; return first ; } [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <algorithm> #include <functional> #include <iostream> #include <iterator> #include <random> int main ( ) { std:: mt19937 rng ; // default constructed, seeded with fixed seed std :: generate_n ( std:: ostream_iterator < std :: mt19937 :: result_type > ( std:: cout , " " ) , 5 , std:: ref ( rng ) ) ; std:: cout << ' \n ' ; } Output: 3499211612 581869302 3890346734 3586334585 545404204 [ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards. DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior LWG 426 C++98 the complexity requirement was “exactly count invocations or assignments”, which is broken if count is negative no invocation or assignment if count is non-positive LWG 865 C++98 the location of the first element following the generation range was not returned returned [ edit ] See also fill_n copy-assigns the given value to N elements in a range (function template) [edit] generate assigns the results of successive function calls to every element in a range (function template) [edit] ranges::generate_n (C++20) saves the result of N applications of a function (algorithm function object) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/algorithm/generate_n&oldid=170446 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 26 March 2024, at 19:04.
