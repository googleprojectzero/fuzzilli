This has the effect of removing the first element from the heap [ first , last ) . 1) [ first , last ) is a heap with respect to operator < (until C++20) std:: less { } (since C++20) . 2) [ first , last ) is a heap with respect to comp . If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined: [ first , last ) is empty. [ first , last ) is not a heap with respect to the corresponding comparator. The type of * first is not Swappable . (until C++11) RandomIt is not ValueSwappable . The type of * first is not MoveConstructible . The type of * first is not MoveAssignable . (since C++11) Contents 1 Parameters 2 Complexity 3 Example 4 Defect reports 5 See also [ edit ] Parameters first, last - the pair of iterators defining the non-empty binary heap range of elements to modify (extract root item) comp - comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the requirements of Compare ) which returns true if the first argument is less than the second. The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the following: bool cmp ( const Type1 & a, const Type2 & b ) ; While the signature does not need to have const & , the function must not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category (thus, Type1 & is not allowed , nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is equivalent to a copy (since C++11) ). The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type RandomIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them. Type requirements - RandomIt must meet the requirements of LegacyRandomAccessIterator . - Compare must meet the requirements of Compare . [ edit ] Complexity Given \(\scriptsize N\) N as std:: distance ( first, last ) : 1) At most \(\scriptsize 2\log(N)\) 2log(N) comparisons using operator < (until C++20) std:: less { } (since C++20) . 2) At most \(\scriptsize 2\log(N)\) 2log(N) applications of the comparison function comp .
