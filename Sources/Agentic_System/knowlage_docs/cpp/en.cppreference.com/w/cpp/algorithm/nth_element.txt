For every iterator i in [ first , nth ) and every iterator j in [ nth , last ) , the following condition is met: 1,2) bool ( * j < * i ) (until C++20) std:: less { } ( * j, * i ) (since C++20) is false . 3,4) bool ( comp ( * j, * i ) ) is false . 1) Elements are hypothetically sorted with respect to operator < (until C++20) std:: less { } (since C++20) . 3) Elements are hypothetically sorted with respect to comp . 2,4) Same as (1,3) , but executed according to policy . These overloads participate in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied: std:: is_execution_policy_v < std:: decay_t < ExecutionPolicy >> is true . (until C++20) std:: is_execution_policy_v < std:: remove_cvref_t < ExecutionPolicy >> is true . (since C++20) If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined: [ first , nth ) or [ nth , last ) is not a valid range . The type of * first is not Swappable . (until C++11) RandomIt is not ValueSwappable . The type of * first is not MoveConstructible . The type of * first is not MoveAssignable . (since C++11) Contents 1 Parameters 2 Complexity 3 Exceptions 4 Possible implementation 5 Notes 6 Example 7 Defect reports 8 See also [ edit ] Parameters first, last - the pair of iterators defining the range of elements for partial sorting nth - random access iterator defining the sort partition point policy - the execution policy to use comp - comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the requirements of Compare ) which returns ​ true if the first argument is less than (i.e. is ordered before ) the second. The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the following: bool cmp ( const Type1 & a, const Type2 & b ) ; While the signature does not need to have const & , the function must not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category (thus, Type1& is not allowed , nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is equivalent to a copy (since C++11) ). The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type RandomIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them. ​ Type requirements - RandomIt must meet the requirements of LegacyRandomAccessIterator . - Compare must meet the requirements of Compare . [ edit ] Complexity Given \(\scriptsize N\) N as last - first : 1) \(\scriptsize O(N)\) O(N) comparisons using operator < (until C++20) std:: less { } (since C++20) on average. 2) \(\scriptsize O(N)\) O(N) comparisons using operator < (until C++20) std:: less { } (since C++20) , and \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot \log(N))\) O(N·log(N)) swaps. 3) \(\scriptsize O(N)\) O(N) applications of the comparator comp on average. 4) \(\scriptsize O(N)\) O(N) applications of the comparator comp , and \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot \log(N))\) O(N·log(N)) swaps. [ edit ] Exceptions The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report errors as follows: If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies , std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy , the behavior is implementation-defined. If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown. [ edit ] Possible implementation See also the implementations in libstdc++ , libc++ , and MSVC STL . [ edit ] Notes The algorithm used is typically Introselect although other Selection algorithm with suitable average-case complexity are allowed.
