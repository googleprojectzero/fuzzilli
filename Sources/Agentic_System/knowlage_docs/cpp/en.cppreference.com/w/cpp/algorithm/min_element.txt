These overloads participate in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied: std:: is_execution_policy_v < std:: decay_t < ExecutionPolicy >> is true .

(since C++20) Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Complexity 4 Exceptions 5 Possible implementation 6 Example 7 Defect reports 8 See also [ edit ] Parameters first, last - the pair of iterators defining the range of elements to examine policy - the execution policy to use comp - comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the requirements of Compare ) which returns true if the first argument is less than the second. The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the following: bool cmp ( const Type1 & a, const Type2 & b ) ; While the signature does not need to have const & , the function must not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category (thus, Type1 & is not allowed , nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is equivalent to a copy (since C++11) ). The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type ForwardIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them. Type requirements - ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator . [ edit ] Return value Iterator to the smallest element in the range [ first , last ) . If several elements in the range are equivalent to the smallest element, returns the iterator to the first such element. Returns last if the range is empty. [ edit ] Complexity Given \(\scriptsize N\) N as std:: distance ( first, last ) : 1,2) Exactly \(\scriptsize \max(N-1,0)\) max(N-1,0) comparisons using operator < (until C++20) std:: less { } (since C++20) . 3,4) Exactly \(\scriptsize \max(N-1,0)\) max(N-1,0) applications of the comparison function comp . [ edit ] Exceptions The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report errors as follows: If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies , std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy , the behavior is implementation-defined. If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.
