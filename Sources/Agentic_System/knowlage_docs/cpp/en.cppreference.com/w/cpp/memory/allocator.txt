The default allocator is stateless, that is, all instances of the given allocator are interchangeable, compare equal and can deallocate memory allocated by any other instance of the same allocator type. The explicit specialization for void lacks the member typedefs reference , const_reference , size_type and difference_type . This specialization declares no member functions. (until C++20) The default allocator satisfies allocator completeness requirements .

For example, std:: list < T, A > allocates nodes of some internal type Node<T> , using the allocator A::rebind<Node<T>>::other (until C++11) std:: allocator_traits < A > :: rebind_alloc < Node < T >> , which is implemented in terms of A::rebind<Node<T>>::other if A is an std::allocator (since C++11) . Member type is_always_equal is deprecated via LWG issue 3170 , because it makes custom allocators derived from std::allocator treated as always equal by default. std:: allocator_traits < std :: allocator < T >> :: is_always_equal is not deprecated and its member constant value is true for any T . [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <iostream> #include <memory> #include <string> int main ( ) { // default allocator for ints std :: allocator < int > alloc1 ; // demonstrating the few directly usable members static_assert ( std:: is_same_v < int , decltype ( alloc1 ) :: value_type > ) ; int * p1 = alloc1. allocate ( 1 ) ; // space for one int alloc1. deallocate ( p1, 1 ) ; // and it is gone // Even those can be used through traits though, so no need using traits_t1 = std:: allocator_traits < decltype ( alloc1 ) > ; // The matching trait p1 = traits_t1 :: allocate ( alloc1, 1 ) ; traits_t1 :: construct ( alloc1, p1, 7 ) ; // construct the int std:: cout << * p1 << ' \n ' ; traits_t1 :: deallocate ( alloc1, p1, 1 ) ; // deallocate space for one int // default allocator for strings std :: allocator < std:: string > alloc2 ; // matching traits using traits_t2 = std:: allocator_traits < decltype ( alloc2 ) > ; // Rebinding the allocator using the trait for strings gets the same type traits_t2 :: rebind_alloc < std:: string > alloc_ = alloc2 ; std:: string * p2 = traits_t2 :: allocate ( alloc2, 2 ) ; // space for 2 strings traits_t2 :: construct ( alloc2, p2, "foo" ) ; traits_t2 :: construct ( alloc2, p2 + 1 , "bar" ) ; std:: cout << p2 [ 0 ] << ' ' << p2 [ 1 ] << ' \n ' ; traits_t2 :: destroy ( alloc2, p2 + 1 ) ; traits_t2 :: destroy ( alloc2, p2 ) ; traits_t2 :: deallocate ( alloc2, p2, 2 ) ; } Output: 7 foo bar [ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
