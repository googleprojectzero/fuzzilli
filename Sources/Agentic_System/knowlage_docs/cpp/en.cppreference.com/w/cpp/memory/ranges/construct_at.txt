Args > constexpr T * construct_at ( T * location, Args && ... args ) ; (since C++20) Creates a T object initialized with the arguments in args at given address location . Equivalent to if constexpr ( std:: is_array_v < T > ) return :: new ( voidify ﻿ ( * location ) ) T [ 1 ] ( ) ; else return :: new ( voidify ﻿ ( * location ) ) T ( std:: forward < Args > ( args ) ... ) ; , except that construct_at may be used in evaluation of constant expressions (until C++26) . When construct_at is called in the evaluation of some constant expression expr , location must point to either a storage obtained by std:: allocator < T > :: allocate or an object whose lifetime began within the evaluation of expr . This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied: std:: is_unbounded_array_v < T > is false . :: new ( std:: declval < void * > ( ) ) T ( std:: declval < Args > ( ) ... ) is well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand . If std:: is_array_v < T > is true and sizeof... ( Args ) is nonzero, the program is ill-formed. The function-like entities described on this page are algorithm function objects (informally known as niebloids ), that is: Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them. None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup . When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited. Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Notes 4 Example 5 Defect reports 6 See also [ edit ] Parameters location - pointer to the uninitialized storage on which a T object will be constructed args... - arguments used for initialization [ edit ] Return value location [ edit ] Notes std::ranges::construct_at behaves exactly same as std::construct_at , except that it is invisible to argument-dependent lookup. [ edit ] Example Run this code #include <iostream> #include <memory> struct S { int x ; float y ; double z ; S ( int x, float y, double z ) : x { x } , y { y } , z { z } { std:: cout << "S::S(); \n " ; } ~S ( ) { std:: cout << "S::~S(); \n " ; } void print ( ) const { std:: cout << "S { x=" << x << "; y=" << y << "; z=" << z << "; }; \n " ; } } ; int main ( ) { alignas ( S ) unsigned char buf [ sizeof ( S ) ] ; S * ptr = std :: ranges :: construct_at ( reinterpret_cast < S * > ( buf ) , 42 , 2.71828f , 3.1415 ) ; ptr - > print ( ) ; std :: ranges:: destroy_at ( ptr ) ; } Output: S::S(); S { x=42; y=2.71828; z=3.1415; }; S::~S(); [ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
