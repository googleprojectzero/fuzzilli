Every specialization of allocation_result has no base classes or declared members other than ptr and count , thus it is suitable for aggregate initialization and structured binding . Contents 1 Template parameters 2 Data members 3 Notes 4 Example 5 See also [ edit ] Template parameters Pointer - typically std:: allocator_traits < Alloc > :: pointer , where Alloc is an Allocator type SizeType - typically std:: allocator_traits < Alloc > :: size_type , where Alloc is an Allocator type [ edit ] Data members Member name Definition ptr a pointer of type Pointer which is typically used for the address of the first element in the storage allocated by allocate_at_least (public member object) count a value of type SizeType which is typically used for the actual number of elements in the storage allocated by allocate_at_least (public member object) [ edit ] Notes Pointer and SizeType are a pointer to an object type and std:: make_unsigned_t < std:: ptrdiff_t > (which is almost always same as std::size_t ) by default.
