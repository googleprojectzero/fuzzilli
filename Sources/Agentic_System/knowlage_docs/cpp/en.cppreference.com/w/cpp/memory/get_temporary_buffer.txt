Otherwise, requests to allocate uninitialized contiguous storage for count adjacent objects of type T . The request is non-binding, and the implementation may instead allocate the storage for any other number of (including zero) adjacent objects of type T . It is implementation-defined whether over-aligned types are supported. (since C++11) Contents 1 Parameters 2 Return value 3 Notes 4 Example 5 Defect reports 6 See also [ edit ] Parameters count - the desired number of objects [ edit ] Return value A std::pair , the member first is a pointer to the beginning of the allocated storage and the member second is the number of objects that fit in the storage that was actually allocated. If count <= 0 or allocated storage is not enough to store a single element of type T , the member first of the result is a null pointer and the member second is zero. [ edit ] Notes This API was originally designed with the intent of providing a more efficient implementation than the general-purpose operator new , but no such implementation was created and the API was deprecated and removed. [ edit ] Example [edit] Run this code #include <algorithm> #include <iostream> #include <iterator> #include <memory> #include <string> int main ( ) { const std:: string s [ ] = { "string" , "1" , "test" , "..." } ; const auto p = std :: get_temporary_buffer < std:: string > ( 4 ) ; // requires that p.first is passed to return_temporary_buffer // (beware of early exit points and exceptions), or better use: std:: unique_ptr < std:: string , void ( * ) ( std:: string * ) > on_exit ( p. first , [ ] ( std:: string * p ) { std:: cout << "returning temporary buffer... \n " ; std:: return_temporary_buffer ( p ) ; } ) ; std:: copy ( s, s + p. second , std:: raw_storage_iterator < std:: string * , std:: string > ( p. first ) ) ; // has same effect as: std::uninitialized_copy(s, s + p.second, p.first); // requires that each string in p is individually destroyed // (beware of early exit points and exceptions) std:: copy ( p. first , p. first + p. second , std:: ostream_iterator < std:: string > { std:: cout , " \n " } ) ; std:: for_each ( p. first , p. first + p. second , [ ] ( std:: string & e ) { e.~basic_string < char > ( ) ; } ) ; // same as: std::destroy(p.first, p.first + p.second); // manually reclaim memory if unique_ptr-like technique is not used: // std::return_temporary_buffer(p.first); } Output: string 1 test ... returning temporary buffer... [ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards. DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior LWG 425 C++98 the behavior when count <= 0 was unclear made clear LWG 2072 C++98 it was not allowed to allocate insufficient memory allowed [ edit ] See also return_temporary_buffer (deprecated in C++17) (removed in C++20) frees uninitialized storage (function template) [edit] allocate_at_least [static] (C++23) allocates storage at least as large as the requested size via an allocator (public static member function of std::allocator_traits<Alloc> ) [edit] Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/memory/get_temporary_buffer&oldid=156965 " Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Deutsch Español Français Italiano 日本語 Português Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 18 August 2023, at 00:36.
