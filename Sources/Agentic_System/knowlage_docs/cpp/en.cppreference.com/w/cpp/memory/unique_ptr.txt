The object is disposed of, using the associated deleter, when either of the following happens: the managing unique_ptr object is destroyed. the managing unique_ptr object is assigned another pointer via operator= or reset() . The object is disposed of, using a potentially user-supplied deleter, by calling get_deleter ( ) ( ptr ) . The default deleter ( std::default_delete ) uses the delete operator, which destroys the object and deallocates the memory. A unique_ptr may alternatively own no object, in which case it is described as empty . There are two versions of unique_ptr : Manages a single object (e.g., allocated with new ). Manages a dynamically-allocated array of objects (e.g., allocated with new [ ] ). The class satisfies the requirements of MoveConstructible and MoveAssignable , but of neither CopyConstructible nor CopyAssignable . If T* was not a valid type (e.g., T is a reference type), a program that instantiates the definition of std :: unique_ptr < T, Deleter > is ill-formed. Type requirements - Deleter must be FunctionObject or lvalue reference to a FunctionObject or lvalue reference to function, callable with an argument of type unique_ptr < T, Deleter > :: pointer .

If an object's lifetime is managed by a const std :: unique_ptr , it is limited to the scope in which the pointer was created. unique_ptr is commonly used to manage the lifetime of objects, including: providing exception safety to classes and functions that handle objects with dynamic lifetime, by guaranteeing deletion on both normal exit and exit through exception. passing ownership of uniquely-owned objects with dynamic lifetime into functions. acquiring ownership of uniquely-owned objects with dynamic lifetime from functions. as the element type in move-aware containers, such as std::vector , which hold pointers to dynamically-allocated objects (e.g. if polymorphic behavior is desired). unique_ptr may be constructed for an incomplete type T , such as to facilitate the use as a handle in the pImpl idiom . If the default deleter is used, T must be complete at the point in code where the deleter is invoked, which happens in the destructor, move assignment operator, and reset member function of unique_ptr . (In contrast, std::shared_ptr cannot be constructed from a raw pointer to incomplete type, but can be destroyed where T is incomplete). Note that if T is a class template specialization, use of unique_ptr as an operand, e.g. ! p requires T 's parameters to be complete due to ADL . If T is a derived class of some base B , then unique_ptr < T > is implicitly convertible to unique_ptr < B > . The default deleter of the resulting unique_ptr < B > will use operator delete for B , leading to undefined behavior unless the destructor of B is virtual . Note that std::shared_ptr behaves differently: std:: shared_ptr < B > will use the operator delete for the type T and the owned object will be deleted correctly even if the destructor of B is not virtual . Unlike std::shared_ptr , unique_ptr may manage an object through any custom handle type that satisfies NullablePointer . This allows, for example, managing objects located in shared memory, by supplying a Deleter that defines typedef boost::offset_ptr pointer; or another fancy pointer .
