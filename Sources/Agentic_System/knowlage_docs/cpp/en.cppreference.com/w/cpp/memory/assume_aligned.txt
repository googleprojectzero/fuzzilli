The implementation may use this information to generate more efficient code, but it might only make this assumption if the object is accessed via the return value of assume_aligned . N must be a power of 2. The behavior is undefined if ptr does not point to an object of type T (ignoring cv-qualification at every level), or if the object's alignment is not at least N . Contents 1 Return value 2 Exceptions 3 Notes 4 Example 5 See also [ edit ] Return value ptr . [ edit ] Exceptions Throws nothing. [ edit ] Notes To ensure that the program benefits from the optimizations enabled by assume_aligned , it is important to access the object via its return value: void f ( int * p ) { int * p1 = std :: assume_aligned < 256 > ( p ) ; // Use p1, not p, to ensure benefit from the alignment assumption. // However, the program has undefined behavior if p is not aligned // regardless of whether p1 is used. } It is up to the program to ensure that the alignment assumption actually holds. A call to assume_aligned does not cause the compiler to verify or enforce this.
