Contents 1 Syntax 2 Explanation 3 Default-initialization of a const object 4 Indeterminate and erroneous values 4.1 Special cases 5 Notes 6 Example 7 Defect reports 8 See also [ edit ] Syntax T object ﻿ ; (1) new T (2) [ edit ] Explanation Default-initialization is performed in three situations: 1) when a variable with automatic, static, or thread-local storage duration is declared with no initializer; 2) when an object with dynamic storage duration is created by a new-expression with no initializer; 3) when a base class or a non-static data member is not mentioned in a constructor initializer list and that constructor is called. The effects of default-initialization are: if T is a (possibly cv-qualified) non-POD (until C++11) class type, the constructors are considered and subjected to overload resolution against the empty argument list. The constructor selected (which is one of the default constructors ) is called to provide the initial value for the new object; if T is an array type, every element of the array is default-initialized; otherwise, no initialization is performed (see notes ). Only (possibly cv-qualified) non-POD class types (or arrays thereof) with automatic storage duration were considered to be default-initialized when no initializer is used. Scalars and POD types with dynamic storage duration were considered to be not initialized (since C++11, this situation was reclassified as a form of default-initialization). (until C++11) [ edit ] Default-initialization of a const object If a program calls for the default-initialization of an object of a const -qualified type T , T shall be a const-default-constructible class type or array thereof. A class type T is const-default-constructible if default-initialization of T would invoke a user-provided constructor of T (not inherited from a base class) (since C++11) or if each direct non-static data member M of T is of class type X (or array thereof), X is const-default-constructible, and T has no direct variant members , and (until C++11) each direct non-variant non-static data member M of T has a default member initializer or, if M is of class type X (or array thereof), X is const-default-constructible, if T is a union with at least one non-static data member, exactly one variant member has a default member initializer, if T is not a union, for each anonymous union member with at least one non-static data member (if any), exactly one non-static data member has a default member initializer, and (since C++11) each potentially constructed base class of T is const-default-constructible. [ edit ] Indeterminate and erroneous values When storage for an object with automatic or dynamic storage duration is obtained, the object has an indeterminate value . If no initialization is performed for an object, that object retains an indeterminate value until that value is replaced. (until C++26) When storage for an object with automatic or dynamic storage duration is obtained, the bytes comprising the storage for the object have the following initial value: If the object has dynamic storage duration, or is the object associated with a variable or function parameter whose first declaration is marked with [[ indeterminate ]] , the bytes have indeterminate values . Otherwise, the bytes have erroneous values , where each value is determined by the implementation independently of the state of the program. If no initialization is performed for an object (including subobjects ), such a byte retains its initial value until that value is replaced. If any bit in the value representation has an indeterminate value, the object has an indeterminate value . Otherwise, if any bit in the value representation has an erroneous value, the object has an erroneous value . (since C++26) If an evaluation produces an indeterminate value, the behavior is undefined . If an evaluation produces an erroneous value, the behavior is erroneous . (since C++26) [ edit ] Special cases The following types are uninitialized-friendly : std::byte (since C++17) unsigned char char , if its underlying type is unsigned char Given an indeterminate or erroneous (since C++26) value value , the uninitialized result value of value is: An indeterminate value, if value is also an indeterminate value. value , if value is an erroneous value. (since C++26) If an evaluation eval produces an indeterminate or erroneous (since C++26) value value of an uninitialized-friendly type, the behavior is well-defined in the following cases: eval is the evaluation of one of the following expressions and operands: The second or third operand of a conditional expression . The right operand of a comma expression . The operand of an integral conversion , explicit cast or static_cast to an uninitialized-friendly type. A discarded-value expression . In this case, the result of the operation is the uninitialized result value of value . eval is an evaluation of the right operand of a simple assignment operator whose left operand is an lvalue of an uninitialized-friendly type. In this case, the value of the object referred to by the left operand is replaced by the uninitialized result value of value . eval is the evaluation of the initialization expression when initializing an object of an uninitialized-friendly type. value cannot be of type std::byte if the object being initialized is not of type std::byte . (since C++17) In this case, that object is initialized to the uninitialized result value of value . Converting an indeterminate value of an uninitialized-friendly type produces an indeterminate value. Converting an erroneous value of an uninitialized-friendly type produces an erroneous value, the result of the conversion is the value of the converted operand. (since C++26) // Case 1: Uninitialized objects with dynamic storage duration // All C++ versions: indeterminate value + undefined behavior int f ( bool b ) { unsigned char * c = new unsigned char ; unsigned char d = * c ; // OK, “d” has an indeterminate value int e = d ; // undefined behavior return b ? d : 0 ; // undefined behavior if “b” is true } // Case 2: Uninitialized objects with automatic storage duration // until C++26: indeterminate value + undefined behavior // since C++26: erroneous value + erroneous behavior int g ( bool b ) { unsigned char c ; // “c” has an indeterminate/erroneous value unsigned char d = c ; // no undefined/erroneous behavior, // but “d” has an indeterminate/erroneous value assert ( c == d ) ; // holds, but both integral promotions have // undefined/erroneous behavior int e = d ; // undefined/erroneous behavior return b ? d : 0 ; // undefined/erroneous behavior if “b” is true } // Same as case 2 void h ( ) { int d1, d2 ; // “d1” and “d2” have indeterminate/erroneous values int e1 = d1 ; // undefined/erroneous behavior int e2 = d1 ; // undefined/erroneous behavior assert ( e1 == e2 ) ; // holds assert ( e1 == d1 ) ; // holds, undefined/erroneous behavior assert ( e2 == d1 ) ; // holds, undefined/erroneous behavior // no undefined/erroneous behavior, // but “d2” has an indeterminate/erroneous value std:: memcpy ( & d2, & d1, sizeof ( int ) ) ; assert ( e1 == d2 ) ; // holds, undefined/erroneous behavior assert ( e2 == d2 ) ; // holds, undefined/erroneous behavior } [ edit ] Notes References and const scalar objects cannot be default-initialized.
