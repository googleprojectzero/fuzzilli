(C++11) Fold expressions (C++17) Pack indexing (C++26) SFINAE Constraints and concepts (C++20) requires expression (C++20) [edit] A template is a C++ entity that defines one of the following: a family of classes ( class template ), which may be nested classes a family of functions ( function template ), which may be member functions an alias to a family of types ( alias template ) (since C++11) a family of variables ( variable template ) (since C++14) a concept ( constraints and concepts ) (since C++20) Templates are parameterized by one or more template parameters , of three kinds: type template parameters, constant template parameters, and template template parameters. When template arguments are provided, or, for function and class (since C++17) templates only, deduced, they are substituted for the template parameters to obtain a specialization of the template, that is, a specific type or a specific function lvalue. Specializations may also be provided explicitly: full specializations are allowed for class , variable (since C++14) and function templates, partial specializations are only allowed for class templates and variable templates (since C++14) . When a class template specialization is referenced in context that requires a complete object type, or when a function template specialization is referenced in context that requires a function definition to exist, the template is instantiated (the code for it is actually compiled), unless the template was already explicitly specialized or explicitly instantiated. Instantiation of a class template does not instantiate any of its member functions unless they are also used. At link time, identical instantiations generated by different translation units are merged. The definition of a class template must be visible at the point of implicit instantiation, which is why template libraries typically provide all template definitions in the headers (e.g., most boost libraries are header-only ).

It may also define a template specialization . concept-name constraint-expression - see constraints and concepts export was an optional modifier which declared the template as exported (when used with a class template, it declared all of its members exported as well). Files that instantiated exported templates did not need to include their definitions: the declaration was sufficient. Implementations of export were rare and disagreed with each other on details. (until C++11) This section is incomplete Reason: core syntax, template parameters, and instantiations, take content common between class_template and function_template [ edit ] Template identifiers A template identifier has one of the following syntaxes: template-name ﻿ < template-argument-list ﻿ (optional) > (1) operator op ﻿ < template-argument-list ﻿ (optional) > (2) operator "" identifier < template-argument-list ﻿ (optional) > (3) (since C++11) (deprecated) operator user-defined-string-literal < template-argument-list ﻿ (optional) > (4) (since C++11) 1) A simple template identifier . 2) An operator function template identifier. 3,4) A literal operator function template identifier. template-name - an identifier that names a template op - an overloadable operator identifier - an identifier user-defined-string-literal - "" followed by an identifier A simple template identifier that names a class template specialization names a class. A template identifier that names an alias template specialization names a type. A template identifier that names a function template specialization names a function. If all following conditions are satisfied, a template identifier is valid ﻿: There are at most as many arguments as there are parameters or a parameter is a template parameter pack (since C++11) . There is an argument for each non-deducible non-pack (since C++11) parameter that does not have a default template argument. Each template argument matches the corresponding template parameter. Substitution of each template argument into the following template parameters (if any) succeeds. If the template identifier is non-dependent , the associated constraints are satisfied as specified below. (since C++20) An invalid simple template id is a compile-time error, unless it names a function template specialization (in which case SFINAE may apply). template < class T, T :: type n = 0 > class X ; struct S { using type = int ; } ; using T1 = X < S, int , int > ; // error: too many arguments using T2 = X <> ; // error: no default argument for first template parameter using T3 = X < 1 > ; // error: value 1 does not match type-parameter using T4 = X < int > ; // error: substitution failure for second template parameter using T5 = X < S > ; // OK When the template-name of a simple template id names a constrained non-function template or a constrained template template parameter, but not a member template that is a member of an unknown specialization, and all template arguments in the simple template id are non-dependent, the associated constraints of the constrained template must be satisfied: template < typename T > concept C1 = sizeof ( T ) ! = sizeof ( int ) ; template < C1 T > struct S1 { } ; template < C1 T > using Ptr = T * ; S1 < int > * p ; // error: constraints not satisfied Ptr < int > p ; // error: constraints not satisfied template < typename T > struct S2 { Ptr < int > x ; } ; // error, no diagnostic required template < typename T > struct S3 { Ptr < T > x ; } ; // OK, satisfaction is not required S3 < int > x ; // error: constraints not satisfied template < template < C1 T > class X > struct S4 { X < int > x ; // error, no diagnostic required } ; template < typename T > concept C2 = sizeof ( T ) == 1 ; template < C2 T > struct S { } ; template struct S < char [ 2 ] > ; // error: constraints not satisfied template <> struct S < char [ 2 ] > { } ; // error: constraints not satisfied (since C++20) If all following conditions are satisfied, two template identifiers are same ﻿: Their template-name ﻿s or operators refer to the same template. Their corresponding type template arguments are the same type. The template parameter values determined by their corresponding constant template arguments are template-argument-equivalent . Their corresponding template template arguments refer to the same template. Two template identifier that are the same refer to the same variable, (since C++14) class, or function. [ edit ] Templated entity A templated entity (or, in some sources, "temploid") is any entity that is defined (or, for a lambda expression , created) (since C++11) within a template definition. All of the following are templated entities: a class/function /variable (since C++14) template a concept (since C++20) a member of a templated entity (such as a non-template member function of a class template) an enumerator of an enumeration that is a templated entity any entity defined or created within a templated entity: a local class, a local variable, a friend function, etc the closure type of a lambda expression that appears in the declaration of a templated entity (since C++11) For example, in template < typename T > struct A { void f ( ) { } } ; the function A::f is not a function template, but is still considered to be templated. A templated function is a function template or a function that is templated. A templated class is a class template or a class that is templated. A templated variable is a variable template or a variable that is templated.
