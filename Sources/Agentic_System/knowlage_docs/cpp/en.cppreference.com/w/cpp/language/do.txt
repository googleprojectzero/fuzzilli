Contents 1 Syntax 2 Explanation 3 Notes 4 Keywords 5 Example 6 See also [ edit ] Syntax attr ﻿ (optional) do statement while ( expression ); attr - (since C++11) any number of attributes expression - an expression statement - a statement (typically a compound statement) [ edit ] Explanation When control reaches a do statement, its statement will be executed unconditionally. Every time statement finishes its execution, expression will be evaluated and contextually converted to bool . If the result is true , statement will be executed again. If the loop needs to be terminated within statement , a break statement can be used as terminating statement. If the current iteration needs to be terminated within statement , a continue statement can be used as shortcut. [ edit ] Notes As part of the C++ forward progress guarantee , the behavior is undefined if a loop that is not a trivial infinite loop (since C++26) without observable behavior does not terminate. Compilers are permitted to remove such loops.
