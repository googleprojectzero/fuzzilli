A conforming C++ compiler is required to issue a diagnostic, even if it defines a language extension that assigns meaning to such code (such as with variable-length arrays). The text of the standard uses shall , shall not , and ill-formed to indicate these requirements. ill-formed, no diagnostic required - The program has semantic errors which may not be diagnosable in general case (e.g. violations of the ODR or other errors that are only detectable at link time). The behavior is undefined if such program is executed. implementation-defined behavior - The behavior of the program varies between implementations, and the conforming implementation must document the effects of each behavior. For example, the type of std::size_t or the number of bits in a byte, or the text of std::bad_alloc::what . A subset of implementation-defined behavior is locale-specific behavior , which depends on the implementation-supplied locale . unspecified behavior - The behavior of the program varies between implementations, and the conforming implementation is not required to document the effects of each behavior. For example, order of evaluation , whether identical string literals are distinct, the amount of array allocation overhead, etc. Each unspecified behavior results in one of a set of valid results. erroneous behavior - The (incorrect) behavior that the implementation is recommended to diagnose. Erroneous behavior is always the consequence of incorrect program code. The evaluation of a constant expression never results in an erroneous behavior. If the execution contains an operation specified as having erroneous behavior, the implementation is permitted and recommended to issue a diagnostic, and is permitted to terminate the execution at an unspecified time after that operation. An implementation can issue a diagnostic if it can determine that erroneous behavior is reachable under an implementation-specific set of assumptions about the program behavior, which can result in false positives. Examples of erroneous behavior #include <cassert> #include <cstring> void f ( ) { int d1, d2 ; // d1, d2 have erroneous values int e1 = d1 ; // erroneous behavior int e2 = d1 ; // erroneous behavior assert ( e1 == e2 ) ; // holds assert ( e1 == d1 ) ; // holds, erroneous behavior assert ( e2 == d1 ) ; // holds, erroneous behavior std:: memcpy ( & d2, & d1, sizeof ( int ) ) ; // no erroneous behavior, but // d2 has an erroneous value assert ( e1 == d2 ) ; // holds, erroneous behavior assert ( e2 == d2 ) ; // holds, erroneous behavior } unsigned char g ( bool b ) { unsigned char c ; // c has erroneous value unsigned char d = c ; // no erroneous behavior, but d has an erroneous value assert ( c == d ) ; // holds, both integral promotions have erroneous behavior int e = d ; // erroneous behavior return b ? d : 0 ; // erroneous behavior if b is true } (since C++26) undefined behavior - There are no restrictions on the behavior of the program. Some examples of undefined behavior are data races, memory accesses outside of array bounds, signed integer overflow, null pointer dereference, more than one modifications of the same scalar in an expression without any intermediate sequence point (until C++11) that is unsequenced (since C++11) , access to an object through a pointer of a different type , etc. Implementations are not required to diagnose undefined behavior (although many simple situations are diagnosed), and the compiled program is not required to do anything meaningful. runtime-undefined behavior - The behavior that is undefined except when it occurs during the evaluation of an expression as a core constant expression . (since C++11) [ edit ] UB and optimization Because correct C++ programs are free of undefined behavior, compilers may produce unexpected results when a program that actually has UB is compiled with optimization enabled: For example, [ edit ] Signed overflow int foo ( int x ) { return x + 1 > x ; // either true or UB due to signed overflow } may be compiled as ( demo ) foo ( int ) : mov eax, 1 ret [ edit ] Access out of bounds int table [ 4 ] = { } ; bool exists_in_table ( int v ) { // return true in one of the first 4 iterations or UB due to out-of-bounds access for ( int i = 0 ; i <= 4 ; i ++ ) if ( table [ i ] == v ) return true ; return false ; } May be compiled as ( demo ) exists_in_table ( int ) : mov eax, 1 ret [ edit ] Uninitialized scalar std:: size_t f ( int x ) { std:: size_t a ; if ( x ) // either x nonzero or UB a = 42 ; return a ; } May be compiled as ( demo ) f ( int ) : mov eax, 42 ret The output shown was observed on an older version of gcc Run this code #include <cstdio> int main ( ) { bool p ; // uninitialized local variable if ( p ) // UB access to uninitialized scalar std:: puts ( "p is true" ) ; if ( ! p ) // UB access to uninitialized scalar std:: puts ( "p is false" ) ; } Possible output: p is true p is false [ edit ] Invalid scalar int f ( ) { bool b = true ; unsigned char * p = reinterpret_cast < unsigned char * > ( & b ) ; * p = 10 ; // reading from b is now UB return b == 0 ; } May be compiled as ( demo ) f ( ) : mov eax, 11 ret [ edit ] Null pointer dereference The examples demonstrate reading from the result of dereferencing a null pointer. int foo ( int * p ) { int x = * p ; if ( ! p ) return x ; // Either UB above or this branch is never taken else return 0 ; } int bar ( ) { int * p = nullptr ; return * p ; // Unconditional UB } may be compiled as ( demo ) foo ( int * ) : xor eax, eax ret bar ( ) : ret [ edit ] Access to pointer passed to std::realloc Choose clang to observe the output shown Run this code #include <cstdlib> #include <iostream> int main ( ) { int * p = ( int * ) std:: malloc ( sizeof ( int ) ) ; int * q = ( int * ) std:: realloc ( p, sizeof ( int ) ) ; * p = 1 ; // UB access to a pointer that was passed to realloc * q = 2 ; if ( p == q ) // UB access to a pointer that was passed to realloc std:: cout << * p << * q << ' \n ' ; } Possible output: 12 [ edit ] Infinite loop without side-effects Choose clang or the latest gcc to observe the output shown. Run this code #include <iostream> bool fermat ( ) { const int max_value = 1000 ; // Non-trivial infinite loop with no side effects is UB for ( int a = 1 , b = 1 , c = 1 ; true ; ) { if ( ( ( a * a * a ) == ( ( b * b * b ) + ( c * c * c ) ) ) ) return true ; // disproved :() a ++ ; if ( a > max_value ) { a = 1 ; b ++ ; } if ( b > max_value ) { b = 1 ; c ++ ; } if ( c > max_value ) c = 1 ; } return false ; // not disproved } int main ( ) { std:: cout << "Fermat's Last Theorem " ; fermat ( ) ? std:: cout << "has been disproved! \n " : std:: cout << "has not been disproved. \n " ; } Possible output: Fermat's Last Theorem has been disproved! [ edit ] Ill-formed with diagnostic message Note that compilers are permitted to extend the language in ways that give meaning to ill-formed programs. The only thing C++ standard requires in such cases is a diagnostic message (compiler warning), unless the program was "ill-formed no diagnostic required". For example, unless language extensions are disabled via --pedantic-errors , GCC will compile the following example with only a warning even though it appears in the C++ standard as an example of an "error" (see also GCC Bugzilla #55783 ) Run this code #include <iostream> // Example tweak, do not use constant double a { 1.0 } ; // C++23 standard, §9.4.5 List-initialization [dcl.init.list], Example #6: struct S { // no initializer-list constructors S ( int , double , double ) ; // #1 S ( ) ; // #2 // ... } ; S s1 = { 1 , 2 , 3.0 } ; // OK, invoke #1 S s2 { a, 2 , 3 } ; // error: narrowing S s3 { } ; // OK, invoke #2 // — end example] S :: S ( int , double , double ) { } S :: S ( ) { } int main ( ) { std:: cout << "All checks have passed. \n " ; } Possible output: main.cpp:17:6: error: type 'double' cannot be narrowed to 'int' in initializer ⮠ list [-Wc++11-narrowing] S s2{a, 2, 3}; // error: narrowing ^ main.cpp:17:6: note: insert an explicit cast to silence this issue S s2{a, 2, 3}; // error: narrowing ^ static_cast<int>( ) 1 error generated.
