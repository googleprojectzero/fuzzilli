Expression evaluation may produce a result (e.g., evaluation of 2 + 2 produces the result 4 ) and may generate side-effects (e.g. evaluation of std:: printf ( "%d" , 4 ) prints the character '4' on the standard output). Each C++ expression is characterized by two independent properties: A type and a value category.

Primary expressions are any of the following: this literals (e.g. 2 or "Hello, world" ) identifier expressions, including suitably declared unqualified identifiers (e.g. n or cout ), suitably declared qualified identifiers (e.g. std::string::npos ), and identifiers to be declared in declarators pack indexing expression (since C++26) lambda expressions (since C++11) fold expressions (since C++17) requires expressions (since C++20) Any expression in parentheses is also classified as a primary expression: this guarantees that the parentheses have higher precedence than any operator. Parentheses preserve value, type, and value category. [ edit ] Literals Literals are the tokens of a C++ program that represent constant values embedded in the source code. integer literals are decimal, octal, hexadecimal or binary numbers of integer type. character literals are individual characters of type char or wchar_t char16_t or char32_t (since C++11) char8_t (since C++20) floating-point literals are values of type float , double , or long double string literals are sequences of characters of type const char [ ] or const wchar_t [ ] const char16_t [ ] or const char32_t [ ] (since C++11) const char8_t [ ] (since C++20) boolean literals are values of type bool , that is true and false nullptr is the pointer literal which specifies a null pointer value user-defined literals are constant values of user-specified type (since C++11) [ edit ] Full-expressions A constituent expression is defined as follows: The constituent expression of an expression is that expression. The constituent expressions of a brace-enclosed initializer list or of a (possibly parenthesized) expression list are the constituent expressions of the elements of the respective list. The constituent expressions of an initializer that begins with = are the constituent expressions of the initializer-clause . int num1 = 0 ; num1 + = 1 ; // Case 1: the constituent expression of “num += 1” is “num += 1” int arr2 [ 2 ] = { 2 , 22 } // Case 2: the constituent expressions // of “{2, 22}” are “2” and “22” // Case 3: the constituent expressions of “= {2, 22}” // are the constituent expressions of “{2, 22}” // (i.e. also “2” and “22”) The immediate subexpressions of an expression E are the constituent expressions of E ’s operands, if E creates an aggregate object, the constituent expressions of each default member initializer used in the initialization, (since C++14) if E is a lambda expression , the initialization of the entities captured by copy and the constituent expressions of the initializer of the captures, (since C++11) any function call that E implicitly invokes, or if E is a function call or implicitly invokes a function, the constituent expressions of each default argument used in the call. A subexpression of an expression E is an immediate subexpression of E or a subexpression of an immediate subexpression of E . Note that expressions appearing in the “function body” of lambda expressions are not subexpressions of the lambda expression. (since C++11) The following expressions are full-expressions ﻿ : unevaluated operands constant expressions immediate invocations (since C++20) declarators of simple declarations or member initializers , including the constituent expressions of the initializers invocations of destructors generated at the end of the lifetime of objects other than temporary objects whose lifetime have not been extended the predicates of contract assertions (since C++26) expressions that are not a subexpression of any another expression and that are not otherwise part of any full-expression If a language construct is defined to produce an implicit call of a function, a use of the language construct is considered to be an expression for the purposes of this definition. Conversions applied to the result of an expression in order to satisfy the requirements of the language construct in which the expression appears are also considered to be part of the full-expression. For an initializer, performing the initialization of the entity (including evaluating default member initializers of an aggregate) (since C++14) is also considered part of the full-expression. [ edit ] Potentially-evaluated expressions An expression is potentially evaluated unless it is the operand of the sizeof operator, or it is the operand of the typeid operator and does not designate an lvalue of polymorphic class type. (until C++11) The following operands are unevaluated operands , they are not evaluated: expressions which the typeid operator applies to, except glvalues of polymorphic class types expressions which are operands of the sizeof operator operands of the noexcept operator operands of the decltype specifier constraint-expression of concept definitions expressions following the requires keyword of requires clauses expressions appearing in requirement-seq of requires expressions (since C++20) An expression is potentially evaluated unless it is an unevaluated operand, or it is a subexpression of an unevaluated operand. (since C++11) Potentially-evaluated expressions are ODR-use . This section is incomplete Reason: example of unevaluated operands [ edit ] Discarded-value expressions A discarded-value expression is an expression that is used for its side-effects only. The value calculated from such expression is discarded. Such expressions include the full-expression of any expression statement , the left-hand operand of the built-in comma operator, or the operand of a cast-expression that casts to the type void . Array-to-pointer and function-to-pointer conversions are never applied to the value calculated by a discarded-value expression. The lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied if and only if the expression is a volatile-qualified glvalue and has one of the following forms (built-in meaning required, possibly parenthesized): id-expression, array subscript expression, class member access expression, indirection, pointer-to-member operation, conditional expression where both the second and the third operands are one of these expressions, comma expression where the right operand is one of these expressions. In addition, if the lvalue is of volatile-qualified class type, a volatile copy constructor is required to initialize the resulting rvalue temporary. If the expression is a non-void prvalue (after any lvalue-to-rvalue conversion that might have taken place), temporary materialization occurs. Compilers may issue warnings when an expression other than cast to void discards a value declared [[ nodiscard ]] . (since C++17) Expression-equivalence A number of expressions e1 , e2 , ..., eN are expression-equivalent if all following conditions are satisfied: They have the same effects. Either they are all constant subexpressions or neither is. Either they are all noexcept or else neither is. e1 is expression-equivalent to e2 if and only if e1 and e2 are expression-equivalent (which means e2 is also expression-equivalent to e1 ). (since C++20) [ edit ] Defect reports The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards. DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior CWG 1054 C++98 assigning a value to a volatile variable might result in an unnecessary read due to the lvalue-to- rvalue conversion applied to the assignment result introduce discarded-value expressions and exclude this case from the list of cases that require the conversion CWG 1343 C++98 sequencing of destructor calls in aggregate initialization was underspecified full-expressions in aggregate initialization are well-specified CWG 1383 C++98 the list of expressions where lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied to discarded-value expressions also covered overloaded operators only cover operators with built-in meaning CWG 1576 C++11 lvalue-to-rvalue conversions were not applied to discarded-value volatile xvalue expressions apply the conversion in this case CWG 2249 C++98 identifiers to be declared in declarators were not id-expressions they are CWG 2431 C++11 the invocations of the destructors of temporaries that are bound to references were not full-expressions they are [ edit ] See also C documentation for Expressions Retrieved from " https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/expressions&oldid=181350 " Category : Todo with reason Navigation Support us Recent changes FAQ Offline version Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Page information In other languages Español 日本語 Русский 中文 This page was last modified on 4 March 2025, at 23:10.
