Torque replaces CodeStubAssembler as the recommended way to implement new builtins. See CodeStubAssembler builtins for the CSA version of this guide. Builtins # In V8, builtins can be seen as chunks of code that are executable by the VM at runtime. A common use case is to implement the functions of builtin objects (such as RegExp or Promise ), but builtins can also be used to provide other internal functionality (e.g. as part of the IC system). V8’s builtins can be implemented using a number of different methods (each with different trade-offs): Platform-dependent assembly language : can be highly efficient, but need manual ports to all platforms and are difficult to maintain. C++ : very similar in style to runtime functions and have access to V8’s powerful runtime functionality, but usually not suited to performance-sensitive areas. JavaScript : concise and readable code, access to fast intrinsics, but frequent usage of slow runtime calls, subject to unpredictable performance through type pollution, and subtle issues around (complicated and non-obvious) JS semantics. Javascript builtins are deprecated and should not be added anymore. CodeStubAssembler : provides efficient low-level functionality that is very close to assembly language while remaining platform-independent and preserving readability. V8 Torque : is a V8-specific domain-specific language that is translated to CodeStubAssembler. As such, it extends upon CodeStubAssembler and offers static typing as well as readable and expressive syntax. The remaining document focuses on the latter and give a brief tutorial for developing a simple Torque builtin exposed to JavaScript. For more complete information about Torque, see the V8 Torque user manual . Writing a Torque builtin # In this section, we will write a simple CSA builtin that takes a single argument, and returns whether it represents the number 42 . The builtin is exposed to JS by installing it on the Math object (because we can). This example demonstrates: Creating a Torque builtin with JavaScript linkage, which can be called like a JS function. Using Torque to implement simple logic: type distinction, Smi and heap-number handling, conditionals. Installation of the CSA builtin on the Math object. In case you’d like to follow along locally, the following code is based off revision 589af9f2 . Defining MathIs42 # Torque code is located in src/builtins/*.tq files, roughly organized by topic. Since we will be writing a Math builtin, we’ll put our definition into src/builtins/math.tq . Since this file doesn't exist yet, we have to add it to torque_files in BUILD.gn . namespace math { javascript builtin MathIs42 ( context : Context, receiver : Object, x : Object) : Boolean { // At this point, x can be basically anything - a Smi, a HeapNumber, // undefined, or any other arbitrary JS object. ToNumber_Inline is defined // in CodeStubAssembler. It inlines a fast-path (if the argument is a number // already) and calls the ToNumber builtin otherwise. const number : Number = ToNumber_Inline ( x ) ; // A typeswitch allows us to switch on the dynamic type of a value. The type // system knows that a Number can only be a Smi or a HeapNumber, so this // switch is exhaustive. typeswitch ( number ) { case ( smi : Smi) : { // The result of smi == 42 is not a Javascript boolean, so we use a // conditional to create a Javascript boolean value. return smi == 42 ? True : False; } case ( heapNumber : HeapNumber) : { return Convert < float64 > ( heapNumber ) == 42 ? True : False; } } } } We put the definition in the Torque namespace math . Since this namespace didn't exist before, we have to add it to torque_namespaces in BUILD.gn . Attaching Math.is42 # Builtin objects such as Math are set up mostly in src/bootstrapper.cc (with some setup occurring in .js files). Attaching our new builtin is simple: // Existing code to set up Math, included here for clarity. Handle < JSObject > math = factory -> NewJSObject ( cons , TENURED ) ; JSObject :: AddProperty ( global , name , math , DONT_ENUM ) ; // […snip…] SimpleInstallFunction ( isolate_ , math , "is42" , Builtins :: kMathIs42 , 1 , true ) ; Now that is42 is attached, it can be called from JS: $ out/debug/d8 d 8 > Math.is42 ( 42 ) ; true d 8 > Math.is42 ( '42.0' ) ; true d 8 > Math.is42 ( true ) ; false d 8 > Math.is42 ( { valueOf: ( ) = > 42 } ) ; true Defining and calling a builtin with stub linkage # Builtins can also be created with stub linkage (instead of JS linkage as we used above in MathIs42 ). Such builtins can be useful to extract commonly-used code into a separate code object that can be used by multiple callers, while the code is only produced once. Let’s extract the code that handles heap numbers into a separate builtin called HeapNumberIs42 , and call it from MathIs42 . The definition is also straightforward. The only difference to our builtin with Javascript linkage is that we omit the keyword javascript and there is no receiver argument. namespace math { builtin HeapNumberIs42 ( implicit context : Context) ( heapNumber : HeapNumber) : Boolean { return Convert < float64 > ( heapNumber ) == 42 ? True : False; } javascript builtin MathIs42 ( implicit context : Context) ( receiver : Object, x : Object) : Boolean { const number : Number = ToNumber_Inline ( x ) ; typeswitch ( number ) { case ( smi : Smi) : { return smi == 42 ? True : False; } case ( heapNumber : HeapNumber) : { // Instead of handling heap numbers inline, we now call our new builtin. return HeapNumberIs42 ( heapNumber ) ; } } } } Why should you care about builtins at all? Why not leave the code inline (or extracted into macros for better readability)? An important reason is code space: builtins are generated at compile-time and included in the V8 snapshot or embedded into the binary. Extracting large chunks of commonly used code to separate builtins can quickly lead to space savings in the 10s to 100s of KBs. Testing stub-linkage builtins # Even though our new builtin uses a non-standard (at least non-C++) calling convention, it’s possible to write test cases for it. The following code can be added to test/cctest/compiler/test-run-stubs.cc to test the builtin on all platforms: TEST ( MathIsHeapNumber42 ) { HandleAndZoneScope scope ; Isolate * isolate = scope . main_isolate ( ) ; Heap * heap = isolate -> heap ( ) ; Zone * zone = scope . main_zone ( ) ; StubTester tester ( isolate , zone , Builtins :: kMathIs42 ) ; Handle < Object > result1 = tester . Call ( Handle < Smi > ( Smi :: FromInt ( 0 ) , isolate ) ) ; CHECK ( result1 -> BooleanValue ( ) ) ; } Branding Terms Privacy Twitter Edit this page on GitHub Except as otherwise noted, any code samples from the V8 project are licensed under V8’s BSD-style license .
