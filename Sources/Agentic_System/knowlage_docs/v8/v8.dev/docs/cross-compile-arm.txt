Cross-compiling and debugging for ARM/Android · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research Cross-compiling and debugging for ARM/Android First, make sure you can build with GN . Then, add android to your .gclient configuration file. target_os = [ 'android' ] # Add this to get Android stuff checked out. The target_os field is a list, so if you're also building on unix it'll look like this: target_os = [ 'android' , 'unix' ] # Multiple target OSes. Run gclient sync , and you’ll get a large checkout under ./third_party/android_tools . Enable developer mode on your phone or tablet, and turn on USB debugging, via instructions here . Also, get the handy adb tool on your path. It’s in your checkout at ./third_party/android_sdk/public/platform-tools . Using gm # Use the tools/dev/gm.py script to automatically build V8 tests and run them on the device. alias gm = /path/to/v8/tools/dev/gm.py gm android_arm.release.check This command pushes the binaries and tests to the /data/local/tmp/v8 directory on the device. Manual build # Use v8gen.py to generate an ARM release or debug build: tools/dev/v8gen.py arm.release Then run gn args out.gn/arm.release and make sure you have the following keys: target_os = "android" # These lines need to be changed manually target_cpu = "arm" # as v8gen.py assumes a simulator build. v8_target_cpu = "arm" is_component_build = false The keys should be the same for debug builds. If you are building for an arm64 device like the Pixel C, which supports 32bit and 64bit binaries, the keys should look like this: target_os = "android" # These lines need to be changed manually target_cpu = "arm64" # as v8gen.py assumes a simulator build. v8_target_cpu = "arm64" is_component_build = false Now build: ninja -C out.gn/arm.release d8 Use adb to copy the binary and snapshot files to the phone: adb shell 'mkdir -p /data/local/tmp/v8/bin' adb push out.gn/arm.release/d8 /data/local/tmp/v8/bin adb push out.gn/arm.release/icudtl.dat /data/local/tmp/v8/bin adb push out.gn/arm.release/snapshot_blob.bin /data/local/tmp/v8/bin rebuffat:~/src/v8$ adb shell bullhead:/ $ cd /data/local/tmp/v8/bin bullhead:/data/local/tmp/v8/bin $ ls v8 icudtl.dat snapshot_blob.bin bullhead:/data/local/tmp/v8/bin $ ./d8 V8 version 5.8 .0 ( candidate ) d 8 > 'w00t!' "w00t!" d 8 > Debugging # d8 # Remote debugging d8 on an Android device is relatively simple. First start gdbserver on the Android device: bullhead:/data/local/tmp/v8/bin $ gdbserver :5039 $D8 < arguments > Then connect to the server on your host device. adb forward tcp:5039 tcp:5039 gdb $D8 gdb > target remote :5039 gdb and gdbserver need to be compatible with each other, if in doubt use the binaries from the Android NDK . Note that by default the d8 binary is stripped (debugging info removed), $OUT_DIR/exe.unstripped/d8 contains the unstripped binary though. Logging # By default, some of d8 ’s debugging output ends up in the Android system log, which can be dumped using logcat . Unfortunately, sometimes part of a particular debugging output is split between system log and adb , and sometimes some part seems to be completely missing. To avoid these issues, it is recommended to add the following setting to the gn args : v8_android_log_stdout = true Floating-point issues # The gn args setting arm_float_abi = "hard" , which is used by the V8 Arm GC Stress bot, can result in completely nonsensical program behavior on hardware different from the one the GC stress bot is using (e.g. on Nexus 7). Using Sourcery G++ Lite # The Sourcery G++ Lite cross compiler suite is a free version of Sourcery G++ from CodeSourcery . There is a page for the GNU Toolchain for ARM Processors . Determine the version you need for your host/target combination. The following instructions use 2009q1-203 for ARM GNU/Linux , and if using a different version please change the URLs and TOOL_PREFIX below accordingly. Installing on host and target # The simplest way of setting this up is to install the full Sourcery G++ Lite package on both the host and target at the same location. This will ensure that all the libraries required are available on both sides. If you want to use the default libraries on the host there is no need the install anything on the target. The following script installs in /opt/codesourcery : #!/bin/sh sudo mkdir /opt/codesourcery cd /opt/codesourcery sudo chown " $USERNAME " . chmod g+ws . umask 2 wget http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/package4571/public/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/arm-2009q1-203-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2 tar -xvf arm-2009q1-203-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2 Profile # Compile a binary, push it to the device, keep a copy of it on the host: adb shell cp /data/local/tmp/v8/bin/d8 /data/local/tmp/v8/bin/d8-version.under.test cp out.gn/arm.release/d8 ./d8-version.under.test Get a profiling log and copy it to the host: adb push benchmarks /data/local/tmp adb shell cd /data/local/tmp/benchmarks ; .. /v8/bin/d8-version.under.test run.js --prof adb shell /data/local/tmp/v8/bin/d8-version.under.test benchmark.js --prof adb pull /data/local/tmp/benchmarks/v8.log ./ Open v8.log in your favorite editor and edit the first line to match the full path of the d8-version.under.test binary on your workstation (instead of the /data/local/tmp/v8/bin/ path it had on the device) Run the tick processor with the host’s d8 and an appropriate nm binary: cp out/x64.release/d8 . # only required once cp out/x64.release/natives_blob.bin . # only required once cp out/x64.release/snapshot_blob.bin . # only required once tools/linux-tick-processor --nm = $( pwd ) /third_party/android_ndk/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-nm Branding Terms Privacy Twitter Edit this page on GitHub Except as otherwise noted, any code samples from the V8 project are licensed under V8’s BSD-style license .
