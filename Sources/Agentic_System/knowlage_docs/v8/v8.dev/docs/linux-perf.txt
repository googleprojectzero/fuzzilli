V8’s Linux perf integration · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research V8’s Linux perf integration V8 has built-in support for the Linux perf tool. It is enable by the --perf-prof command-line options. V8 writes out performance data during execution into a file that can be used to analyze the performance of V8’s JITted code (including JS-function names) with the Linux perf tool. Requirements # linux-perf version 5 or higher (previous version don't have jit support). (See instructions at the end ) Build V8/Chrome with enable_profiling=true for better symbolized C++ code. Building V8 # To use V8’s integration with Linux perf you need to build it with the enable_profiling = true gn flag: echo 'enable_profiling = true' >> out/x64.release/args.gn autoninja -C out/x64.release Profiling d8 with linux-perf-d8.py # After building d8 , you can start using linux perf: tools/profiling/linux-perf-d8.py out/x64.release/d8 path/to/test.js ; A more complete example: echo '(function f() { var s = 0; for (var i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) { s += i; } return s; })();' > test.js ; # Use custom V8 flags and a separate output dir for less clutter: mkdir perf_results tools/profiling/linux-perf-d8.py --perf-data-dir = perf_results \ out/x64.release/d8 --expose-gc --allow-natives-syntax test.js ; # Fancy UI (`-flame` is googler-only, use `-web` as a public alternative): pprof -flame perf_results/XXX_perf.data.jitted ; # Terminal-based tool: perf report -i perf_results/XXX_perf.data.jitted ; Check linux-perf-d8.py --help for more details. Note that you can use all d8 flags after the d8 binary argument. Profiling Chrome or content_shell with linux-perf-chrome.py # You can use the linux-perf-chrome.py script to profile chrome. Make sure to add the required chrome gn flags to get proper C++ symbols. Once your build is ready, you can profile a website with both, full symbols for C++ and JS code. mkdir perf_results ; tools/profiling/linux-perf-chrome.py out/x64.release/chrome \ --perf-data-dir = perf_results --timeout = 30 Navigate to your website and then close the browser (or wait for the --timeout to complete) After quitting the browser linux-perf.py will post-process the files and show a list with a result file for each renderer process: chrome_renderer_1583105_3.perf.data.jitted 19.79MiB chrome_renderer_1583105_2.perf.data.jitted 8.59MiB chrome_renderer_1583105_4.perf.data.jitted 0.18MiB chrome_renderer_1583105_1.perf.data.jitted 0.16MiB Exploring linux-perf results # Finally you can use the Linux perf tool to explore the profile of a d8 or chrome renderer process: perf report -i perf_results/XXX_perf.data.jitted You can also use pprof to generate more visualizations: # Note: `-flame` is google-only, use `-web` as a public alternative: pprof -flame perf_results/XXX_perf.data.jitted ; Low-level linux-perf usage # Using linux-perf with d8 directly # Depending on your use-case you might want to resort to using linux-perf directly with d8 . This requires a two-step process, first perf record creates a perf.data file that has to be post-processed with perf inject to inject the JS-symbols. perf record --call-graph = fp --clockid = mono --freq = max \ --output = perf.data out/x64.release/d8 \ --perf-prof --interpreted-frames-native-stack \ test.js ; perf inject --jit --input = perf.data --output = perf.data.jitted ; perf report --input = perf.data.jitted ; V8 linux-perf Flags # --perf-prof is used to the V8 command-line to record performance samples in JIT code. --interpreted-frames-native-stack is used to create different entry points (copied versions of InterpreterEntryTrampoline) for interpreted functions so they can be distinguished by perf based on the address alone. Since the InterpreterEntryTrampoline has to be copied this comes at slight performance and memory regression. Using linux-perf with chrome directly # You can use the same V8 flags to profile chrome itself. Follow the instructions above for the correct V8 flags and add the required chrome gn flags to your chrome build. Once your build is ready, you can profile a website with both, full symbols for C++ and JS code. out/x64.release/chrome \ --user-data-dir = ` mktemp -d ` \ --no-sandbox --incognito --enable-benchmarking \ --js-flags = '--perf-prof --interpreted-frames-native-stack' After starting up chrome, find the renderer process id using the Task Manager and use it to start profiling: perf record -g -k mono -p $RENDERER_PID -o perf.data Navigate to your website and then continue with the next section on how to evaluate the perf output. After execution finishes, combine the static information gathered from the perf tool with the performance samples output by V8 for JIT code: perf inject --jit --input = perf.data --output = perf.data.jitted Finally you can use the Linux perf tool to explore Build perf # If you have an outdated linux kernel you can build linux-perf with jit support locally. Install a new Linux kernel, and then reboot your machine: sudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-wily ; Install dependencies: sudo apt-get install libdw-dev libunwind8-dev systemtap-sdt-dev libaudit-dev \ libslang2-dev binutils-dev liblzma-dev ; Download kernel sources that include the latest perf tool source: cd some/directory ; git clone --depth 1 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git ; cd tip/tools/perf ; make In the following steps, invoke perf as some/director/tip/tools/perf/perf .
