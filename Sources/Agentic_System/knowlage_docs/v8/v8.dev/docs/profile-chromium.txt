Profiling Chromium with V8 · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research Profiling Chromium with V8 V8’s CPU & heap profilers are trivial to use from V8’s shells, but it may appear confusing how to use them with Chromium. This page should help you with it. Why is using V8’s profilers with Chromium different from using them with V8 shells? # Chromium is a complex application, unlike V8 shells. Below is the list of Chromium features that affect profiler usage: each renderer is a separate process (OK, not actually each, but let’s omit this detail), so they can’t share the same log file; sandbox built around renderer process prevents it from writing to a disk; Developer Tools configure profilers for their own purposes; V8’s logging code contains some optimizations to simplify logging state checks. How to run Chromium to get a CPU profile? # Here is how to run Chromium in order to get a CPU profile from the start of the process: ./Chromium --no-sandbox --user-data-dir = ` mktemp -d ` --incognito --js-flags = '--prof' Please note that you wouldn’t see profiles in Developer Tools, because all the data is being logged to a file, not to Developer Tools. Flags description # --no-sandbox turns off the renderer sandbox so chrome can write to the log file. --user-data-dir is used to create a fresh profile, use this to avoid caches and potential side-effects from installed extensions (optional). --incognito is used to further prevent pollution of your results (optional). --js-flags contains the flags passed to V8: --logfile=%t.log specifies a name pattern for log files. %t gets expanded into the current time in milliseconds, so each process gets its own log file. You can use prefixes and suffixes if you want, like this: prefix-%t-suffix.log . By default every isolate gets a separate log file. --prof tells V8 to write statistical profiling information into the log file. Android # Chrome on Android has a number of unique points that make it a bit more complex to profile. The command line must be written via adb before starting Chrome on the device. As a result, quotes in the command line sometimes get lost, and it is best to separate arguments in --js-flags with a comma rather than trying to use whitespace and quotes. The path for the logfile must be specified as an absolute path to somewhere that is writable on Android’s filesystem. The sandboxing used for renderer processes on Android means that even with --no-sandbox , the renderer process still can’t write to files on the filesystem, therefore --single-process needs to be passed to run the renderer in the same process as the browser process. The .so is embedded in Chrome’s APK which means symbolization needs to convert from APK memory addresses to the unstripped .so file in the builds. The following commands enable profiling on Android: ./build/android/adb_chrome_public_command_line --no-sandbox --single-process --js-flags = '--logfile=/storage/emulated/0/Download/%t.log,--prof' < Close and relaunch Chome on the Android device > adb pull /storage/emulated/0/Download/ < logfile > ./src/v8/tools/linux-tick-processor --apk-embedded-library = out/Release/lib.unstripped/libchrome.so --preprocess < logfile > Notes # Under Windows, be sure to turn on .MAP file creation for chrome.dll , but not for chrome.exe .
