Cross-compiling for iOS · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research Cross-compiling for iOS This page serves as a brief introduction to building V8 for iOS targets. Requirements # A macOS (OS X) host machine with Xcode installed. A 64-bit target iOS device (legacy 32-bit iOS devices are unsupported). V8 v7.5 or newer. jitless is a hard requirement for iOS (as of Dec. 2020). Therefore please use the flags '--expose_gc --jitless' Initial setup # Follow the instructions to build V8 . Fetch additional tools needed for iOS cross-compilation by adding target_os in your .gclient configuration file, located in the parent directory of the v8 source directory: # [... other contents of .gclient such as the 'solutions' variable ...] target_os = [ 'ios' ] After updating .gclient , run gclient sync to download the additional tools. Manual build # This section shows how to build a monolithic V8 version for use on either a physical iOS device or the Xcode iOS simulator. The output of this build is a libv8_monolith.a file that contains all V8 libraries as well as the V8 snapshot. Set up GN build files by running gn args out/release-ios and inserting the following keys: ios_deployment_target = 10 is_component_build = false is_debug = false target_cpu = "arm64" # "x64" for a simulator build. target_os = "ios" use_custom_libcxx = false # Use Xcode's libcxx. v8_enable_i18n_support = false # Produces a smaller binary. v8_monolithic = true # Enable the v8_monolith target. v8_use_external_startup_data = false # The snaphot is included in the binary. v8_enable_pointer_compression = false # Unsupported on iOS. Now build: ninja -C out/release-ios v8_monolith Finally, add the generated libv8_monolith.a file to your Xcode project as a static library.
