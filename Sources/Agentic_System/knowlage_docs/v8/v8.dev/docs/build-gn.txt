Building V8 with GN · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research Building V8 with GN V8 is built with the help of GN . GN is a meta build system of sorts, as it generates build files for a number of other build systems. How you build therefore depends on what “back-end” build system and compiler you’re using. The instructions below assume that you already have a checkout of V8 and that you have installed the build dependencies . More information on GN can be found in Chromium’s documentation or GN’s own docs . Building V8 from source involves three steps: generating build files compiling running tests There are two workflows for building V8: the convenience workflow using a helper script called gm that nicely combines all three steps the raw workflow, where you run separate commands on a lower level for each step manually Building V8 using gm (the convenience workflow) # gm is a convenience all-in-one script that generates build files, triggers the build and optionally also runs the tests. It can be found at tools/dev/gm.py in your V8 checkout. We recommend adding an alias to your shell configuration: alias gm = /path/to/v8/tools/dev/gm.py You can then use gm to build V8 for known configurations, such as x64.release : gm x64.release To run the tests right after the build, run: gm x64.release.check gm outputs all the commands it’s executing, making it easy to track and re-execute them if necessary. gm enables building the required binaries and running specific tests with a single command: gm x64.debug mjsunit/foo cctest/test-bar/* Building V8: the raw, manual workflow # Step 1: generate build files # There are several ways of generating the build files: The raw, manual workflow involves using gn directly. A helper script named v8gen streamlines the process for common configurations. Generating build files using gn # Generate build files for the directory out/foo using gn : gn args out/foo This opens an editor window for specifying the gn arguments . Alternatively, you can pass the arguments on the command line: gn gen out/foo --args = 'is_debug=false target_cpu="x64" v8_target_cpu="arm64"' This generates build files for compiling V8 with the arm64 simulator in release mode. For an overview of all available gn arguments, run: gn args out/foo --list Generate build files using v8gen # The V8 repository includes a v8gen convenience script to more easily generate build files for common configurations. We recommend adding an alias to your shell configuration: alias v8gen = /path/to/v8/tools/dev/v8gen.py Call v8gen --help for more information. List available configurations (or bots from a master): v8gen list v8gen list -m client.v8 Build like a particular bot from the client.v8 waterfall in folder foo : v8gen -b 'V8 Linux64 - debug builder' -m client.v8 foo Step 2: compile V8 # To build all of V8 (assuming gn generated to the x64.release folder), run: ninja -C out/x64.release To build specific targets like d8 , append them to the command: ninja -C out/x64.release d8 Step 3: run tests # You can pass the output directory to the test driver. Other relevant flags are inferred from the build: tools/run-tests.py --outdir out/foo You can also test your most recently compiled build (in out.gn ): tools/run-tests.py --gn Build issues?
