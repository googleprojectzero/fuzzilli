Debugging builtins with GDB · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research Debugging builtins with GDB As of V8 v6.9, it’s possible to create breakpoints in GDB (and possibly other debuggers) to debug CSA / ASM / Torque builtins. (gdb) tb i::Isolate::Init Temporary breakpoint 1 at 0x7ffff706742b: i::Isolate::Init. (2 locations) (gdb) r Thread 1 "d8" hit Temporary breakpoint 1, 0x00007ffff7c55bc0 in Isolate::Init (gdb) br Builtins_RegExpPrototypeExec Breakpoint 2 at 0x7ffff7ac8784 (gdb) c Thread 1 "d8" hit Breakpoint 2, 0x00007ffff7ac8784 in Builtins_RegExpPrototypeExec () Note that it works well to use a temporary breakpoint (shortcut tb in GDB) instead of a regular breakpoint ( br ) for this, since you only need it at process start. Builtins are also visible in stack traces: (gdb) bt #0 0x00007ffff7ac8784 in Builtins_RegExpPrototypeExec () #1 0x00007ffff78f5066 in Builtins_ArgumentsAdaptorTrampoline () #2 0x000039751d2825b1 in ?? () #3 0x000037ef23a0fa59 in ?? () #4 0x0000000000000000 in ?? () Caveats: Only works with embedded builtins. Breakpoints can only be set at the start of the builtin. The initial breakpoint in Isolate::Init is needed prior to setting the builtin breakpoint, since GDB modifies the binary and we verify a hash of the builtins section in the binary at startup. Otherwise, V8 complains about a hash mismatch: # Fatal error in ../../src/isolate.cc, line 117 # Check failed: d.Hash() == d.CreateHash() (11095509419988753467 vs. 3539781814546519144).
