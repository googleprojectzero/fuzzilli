V8 release v4.8 · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research V8 release v4.8 Published 25 November 2015 · Tagged with release Roughly every six weeks, we create a new branch of V8 as part of our release process . Each version is branched from V8’s Git master immediately before Chrome branches for a Chrome Beta milestone. Today we’re pleased to announce our newest branch, V8 version 4.8 , which will be in beta until it is released in coordination with Chrome 48 Stable. V8 4.8 contains a handful of developer-facing features, so we’d like to give you a preview of some of the highlights in anticipation of the release in several weeks. Improved ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) support # This release of V8 provides support for two well-known symbols , built-in symbols from the ES2015 spec that allow developers to leverage several low-level language constructs which were previously hidden. @@isConcatSpreadable # The name for a boolean-valued property that if true indicates an object should be flattened to its array elements by Array.prototype.concat . ( function ( ) { 'use strict' ; class AutomaticallySpreadingArray extends Array { get [ Symbol . isConcatSpreadable ] ( ) { return true ; } } const first = [ 1 ] ; const second = new AutomaticallySpreadingArray ( ) ; second [ 0 ] = 2 ; second [ 1 ] = 3 ; const all = first . concat ( second ) ; // Outputs [1, 2, 3] console . log ( all ) ; } ( ) ) ; @@toPrimitive # The name for a method to invoke on an object for implicit conversions to primitive values. ( function ( ) { 'use strict' ; class V8 { [ Symbol . toPrimitive ] ( hint ) { if ( hint === 'string' ) { console . log ( 'string' ) ; return 'V8' ; } else if ( hint === 'number' ) { console . log ( 'number' ) ; return 8 ; } else { console . log ( 'default:' + hint ) ; return 8 ; } } } const engine = new V8 ( ) ; console . log ( Number ( engine ) ) ; console . log ( String ( engine ) ) ; } ( ) ) ; ToLength # The ES2015 spec adjusts the abstract operation for type conversion to convert an argument to an integer suitable for use as the length of an array-like object. (While not directly observable, this change might be indirectly visible when dealing with array-like objects with negative length.) V8 API # Please check out our summary of API changes . This document gets regularly updated a few weeks after each major release. Developers with an active V8 checkout can use git checkout -b 4.8 -t branch-heads/4.8 to experiment with the new features in V8 v4.8. Alternatively you can subscribe to Chrome's Beta channel and try the new features out yourself soon. Posted by the V8 team.
