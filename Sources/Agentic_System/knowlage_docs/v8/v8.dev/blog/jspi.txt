Introducing the WebAssembly JavaScript Promise Integration API · V8 V8 Show navigation Home Blog Docs Tools JS/Wasm features Research Introducing the WebAssembly JavaScript Promise Integration API Published 01 July 2024 · Tagged with WebAssembly The JavaScript Promise Integration (JSPI) API allows WebAssembly applications that were written assuming synchronous access to external functionality to operate smoothly in an environment where the functionality is actually asynchronous . This note outlines what the core capabilities of the JSPI API are, how to access it, how to develop software for it and offers some examples to try out. What is ‘JSPI’ for? # Asynchronous APIs operate by separating the initiation of the operation from its resolution ; with the latter coming some time after the first. Most importantly, the application continues execution after kicking off the operation; and is then notified when the operation completes. For example, using the fetch API , Web applications can access the contents associated with a URL; however, the fetch function does not directly return the results of the fetch; instead it returns a Promise object. The connection between the fetch response and the original request is reestablished by attaching a callback to that Promise object. The callback function can inspect the response and collect the data (if it is there of course). On the other hand, many cases C/C++ (and many other languages) applications are originally written against a synchronous API. For example, the Posix read function does not complete until the I/O operation is complete: the read function blocks until the read is complete. However, it is not permitted to block the browser’s main thread; and many environments are not supportive of synchronous programming. The result is a mismatch between the desires of the application programmer for a simple to use API and the wider ecosystem that requires I/O to be crafted with asynchronous code. This is especially a problem for existing legacy applications that would be expensive to port. The JSPI is an API that bridges the gap between synchronous applications and asynchronous Web APIs. It works by intercepting Promise objects returned by asynchronous Web API functions and suspending the WebAssembly application. When the asynchronous I/O operation is completed, the WebAssembly application is resumed . This allows the WebAssembly application to use straight-line code to perform asynchronous operations and to process their results. Crucially, using JSPI requires very few changes to the WebAssembly application itself. How does JSPI work? # The JSPI works by intercepting the Promise object returned from calls to JavaScript and suspending the main logic of the WebAssembly application. A callback is attached to this Promise object which will resume the suspended WebAssembly code when invoked by the browser's event loop task runner. In addition, the WebAssembly export is refactored to return a Promise object — instead of the original returned value from the export. This Promise object becomes the value returned by the WebAssembly application: when the WebAssembly code is suspended, [1] the exported Promise object is returned as the value of the call into WebAssembly. The export Promise is resolved when the original call completes: if the original WebAssembly function returns a normal value the export Promise object is resolved with that value (converted to a JavaScript object); if an exception is thrown then the export Promise object is rejected. Wrapping imports and exports # This is enabled by wrapping imports and exports during the WebAssembly module instantiation phase. The function wrappers add the suspending behavior to the normal asynchronous imports and route suspensions to Promise object callbacks. It is not necessary to wrap all the exports and imports of a WebAssembly module. Some exports whose execution paths don’t involve calling asynchronous APIs are better left unwrapped. Similarly, not all of a WebAssembly module’s imports are to asynchronous API functions; those imports too should not be wrapped. Of course, there is a significant amount of internal mechanisms that allow this to happen; [2] but neither the JavaScript language nor WebAssembly itself are changed by the JSPI. Its operations are confined to the boundary between JavaScript and WebAssembly. From the perspective of a Web application developer, the result is a body of code that participates in the JavaScript world of async functions and Promises in an analogous way that other async functions written in JavaScript work. From the perspective of the WebAssembly developer, this allows them to craft applications using synchronous APIs and yet participate in the Web’s asynchronous ecosystem. Expected performance # Because the mechanisms used when suspending and resuming WebAssembly modules are essentially constant time, we don’t anticipate high costs in using JSPI — especially compared to other transformation based approaches. There is a constant amount of work needed to propagate the Promise object returned by the asynchronous API call to the WebAssembly. Similarly, when a Promise is resolved, the WebAssembly application can be resumed with constant-time overhead. However, as with other Promise-style APIs in the browser, any time the WebAssembly application suspends it will not be ‘woken up’ again except by the browser’s task runner. This requires that the execution of the JavaScript code that started the WebAssembly computation itself returns to the browser. Can I use JSPI to suspend JavaScript programs? # JavaScript already has a well developed mechanism for representing asynchronous computations: the Promise object and the async function notation. The JSPI is designed to integrate well with this but not to replace it. In particular, it is not permitted to cause JavaScript code to be suspended by using JSPI. How can I use JSPI today? # JSPI is currently phase 4 in the W3C WebAssembly WG. This means that the specification has been voted on by the W3C Wasm CG -- it is effectively standardized. In addition, it is available in Chrome 137, and in Firefox 139. JSPI is available for Chrome on Linux, MacOS, Windows and ChromeOS, on Intel and Arm platforms, both 64 bit and 32 bit. Below we show how you can use Emscripten to generate a WebAssembly module in C/C++ that uses JSPI. If your application involves a different language, not using Emscripten for example, then we suggest that you look at how the API works by reading the proposal . A small demo # To see all this working, let’s try a simple example. This C program computes Fibonacci in a spectacularly bad way: by asking JavaScript to do the addition, even worse by using JavaScript Promise objects to do it: [3] long promiseFib ( long x ) { if ( x == 0 ) return 0 ; if ( x == 1 ) return 1 ; return promiseAdd ( promiseFib ( x - 1 ) , promiseFib ( x - 2 ) ) ; } // promise an addition EM_ASYNC_JS ( long , promiseAdd , ( long x , long y ) , { return Promise . resolve ( x + y ) ; } ) ; The promiseFib function itself is a straightforward recursive version of the Fibonacci function. The intriguing part (from our point of view) is the definition of promiseAdd which does the addition of the two Fibonacci halves — using JSPI!. We use the EM_ASYNC_JS Emscripten macro to write down the promiseFib function as a JavaScript function within the body of our C program. Since addition does not normally involve Promises in JavaScript, we have to force it by constructing a Promise . The EM_ASYNC_JS macro generates all the necessary glue code so that we can use JSPI to access the Promise’s result as though it were a normal function. To compile our small demo, we use Emscripten’s emcc compiler: [4] emcc -O3 badfib.c -o b.html -s JSPI This compiles our program, creating a loadable HTML file ( b.html ). The most special command line option here is -s JSPI . This invokes the option to generate code that uses JSPI to interface with JavaScript imports that return Promises. If you load the generated b.html file into Chrome, then you should see output that approximates to: fib(0) 0μs 0μs 0μs fib(1) 0μs 0μs 0μs fib(2) 0μs 0μs 3μs fib(3) 0μs 0μs 4μs … fib(15) 0μs 13μs 1225μs This is simply a list of the first 15 Fibonacci numbers followed by the average time in microseconds it took to compute a single Fibonacci number. The three time values on each line refer to the time taken for a pure WebAssembly computation, for a mixed JavaScript/WebAssembly computation and the third number gives the time for a suspending version of the computation. Note that fib(2) is the smallest calculation that involves accessing a Promise, and, by the time fib(15) is computed, approximately 1000 calls to promiseAdd have been made. This suggests that the actual cost of a JSPI’d function is approximately 1μs — significantly higher than just adding two integers but much smaller than the milliseconds typically required for accessing an external I/O function. Using JSPI to load code lazily # In this next example we are going to look at what may be a somewhat surprising use of JSPI: dynamically loading code. The idea is to fetch a module that contains needed code, but to delay that until the needed function is first called. We need to use JSPI because APIs like fetch are inherently asynchronous in nature, but we want to be able to invoke them from arbitrary places in our application—in particular, from the middle of a call to a function that does not yet exist. The core idea is to replace a dynamically loaded function with a stub; this stub first of all loads the missing function code, replaces itself by the loaded code, and then calls the newly loaded code with the original arguments. Any subsequent call to the function goes directly to the loaded function. This strategy allows for an essentially transparent approach to dynamically loading code. The module we are going to load is fairly simple, it contains a function that returns 42 : // This is a simple provider of forty-two # include <emscripten.h> EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE long provide42 ( ) { return 42l ; } which is in a file called p42.c , and is compiled using Emscripten without building any ‘extras’: emcc p42.c -o p42.wasm --no-entry -Wl,--import-memory The EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE prefix is an Emscripten macro that makes sure that the function provide42 is not eliminated even though it is not used within the code. This results in a WebAssembly module that contains the function that we want to load dynamically. The -Wl,--import-memory flag that we added to the build of p42.c is to ensure that it has access to the same memory that the main module has. [5] In order to dynamically load code, we use the standard WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming API: WebAssembly . instantiateStreaming ( fetch ( 'p42.wasm' ) ) ; This expression uses fetch to locate the compiled Wasm module, WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming to compile the result of the fetch and to create an instantiated module from it. Both fetch and WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming return Promises; so we cannot simply access the result and extract our needed function. Instead we wrap this into an JSPI-style import using the EM_ASYNC_JS macro: EM_ASYNC_JS ( fooFun , resolveFun , ( ) , { console . log ( 'loading promise42' ) ; LoadedModule = ( await WebAssembly . instantiateStreaming ( fetch ( 'p42.wasm' ) ) ) . instance ; return addFunction ( LoadedModule . exports [ 'provide42' ] ) ; } ) ; Notice the console.log call, we will use it to make sure that our logic is correct. The addFunction is part of the Emscripten API, but to make sure that it is available for us at run-time, we have to inform emcc that it is a required dependency. We do that in the following line: EM_JS_DEPS ( funDeps , "$addFunction" ) In a situation where we want to dynamically load code, we would like to make sure that we don’t load code unnecessarily; in this case, we would like to make sure that subsequent calls to provide42 will not trigger reloads. C has a simple feature that we can use for this: we don’t call provide42 directly, but do so via a trampoline that will cause the function to be loaded, and then, just before actually invoking the function, change the trampoline to bypass itself. We can do this using an appropriate function pointer: extern fooFun get42 ; long stub ( ) { get42 = resolveFun ( ) ; return get42 ( ) ; } fooFun get42 = stub ; From the perspective of the rest of the program, the function that we want to call is called get42 . Its initial implementation is via stub , which calls resolveFun to actually load the function. After the successful load, we change get42 to point to the newly loaded function – and call it. Our main function calls get42 twice: [6] int main ( ) { printf ( "first call p42() = %ld\n" , get42 ( ) ) ; printf ( "second call = %ld\n" , get42 ( ) ) ; } The result of running this in the browser is a log that looks like: loading promise42 first call p42() = 42 second call = 42 Notice that the line loading promise42 only appears once, whereas get42 is actually called twice. This example demonstrates that JSPI can be used in some unexpected ways: loading code dynamically seems a long way from creating promises. Moreover, there are other ways of dynamically linking WebAssembly modules together; this is not intended to represent the definitive solution to that problem. We are definitely looking forward to seeing what you can do with this new capability! Join the discussion at the W3C WebAssembly Community Group repo .
