///
/// Executes various program reducers to shrink a program in size while retaining its special aspects. All of this
/// happens on a separate dispatch queue so the main queue stays responsive.
///
/// There are two basic principles for program minimization:
///   - Minimization must only remove program features that can be added back through mutations later on.
///     For example, variadic inputs to instructions can be removed because the OperationMutator can add them back.
///   - Minimization should generally strive to be as powerful as possible, i.e. be able to find the smallest possible programs.
///     To counter "over-minimization" (i.e. programs becoming too small, making mutations less effective), there should
///     be a configurable limit to minimization which keeps some random instructions alive, so that those are uniformly
///     distributed and not biased to a certain type of instruction or instruction sequence.
///
/// We *cannot* store any information as indices as they are invalidated as soon as any reducer moves instructions around.
/// Therefore, also every reducer needs to preserve flags when they operate on an instruction or operation.
