/// Mutator to fix invalid or "boring" code.
///
/// This attempts to "fix" the following things:
///   * Guarded operations that don't raise an exception are converted to unguarded ones (i.e. it drops try-catch when not needed)
///   * Accesses to non-existent properties/elements (or where the access raises an exception) (TODO)
///   * Invalid function-, method-, or constructor calls (for example if the callee is not a function or if arguments are invalid) (TODO)
///   * Superfluous try-catch statements (when no exception is thrown) (TODO)
///   * Arithmetic operations producing NaN, indicating that no meaningful operation was performed (TODO)
///
/// This mutator works as follows:
/// 1. Convert "fixable" instructions into JavaScript Actions (see RuntimeAssistedMutator) and replace them with Fixup instructions (which contain the respective Action)
/// 2. Execute the instrumented program in the target JavaScript engine
/// 3. On the JavaScript side, when executing a Fixup operation, inspect the associated Action and determine if it can/should be modified (for example by replacing a non-existent property/method with an existing one in a property access/method call), then execute the Action (at which point we can determine if a try-catch is needed for it)
/// 4. Finally, send the modified Actions back to Fuzzilli which will replace the Fixup instructions with the (potentially modified) Actions to generate the final program.
///
