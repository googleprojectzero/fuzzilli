/// This mutator explores what can be done with existing variables in a program.
///
/// It's main purpose is to figure out what can be done with variables whose precise type cannot be statically determined and to
/// find any features not included in the environment model (e.g. new builtins or new properties/methods on certain object types).
///
/// This mutator achieves this by doing the following:
/// 1. It instruments the given program by inserting special "Explore" operations for existing variables.
/// 2. It executes the resulting (intermediate) program. The Explore operations will be lifted
///   to a call to a chunk of code that inspects the variable at runtime (using features like 'typeof' and
///   'Object.getOwnPropertyNames' in JavaScript) and selects a "useful" action to perform on it
///   (e.g. load a property, call a method, ...). At the end or program execution, all these "actions"
///   are reported back to Fuzzilli through the special FUZZOUT channel.
/// 3. The mutator processes the output of step 2 and replaces all successful Explore operations with the concrete
///   action that was performed by them at runtime (so for example a GetProperty or CallMethod operation)
///
/// The result is a program that performs useful actions on some of the existing variables even without
/// statically knowing their type. The resulting program is also deterministic and "JIT friendly" as it
/// no longer relies on any kind of runtime object inspection.
///
/// A large bit of the logic of this mutator is located in the lifter code that implements Explore operations
/// in the target language. For JavaScript, that logic can be found in JavaScriptExploreLifting.swift.
