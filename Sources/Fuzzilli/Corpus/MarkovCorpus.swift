/// Corpus & Scheduler based on 
/// Coverage-based Greybox Fuzzing as Markov Chain paper
/// https://mboehme.github.io/paper/TSE18.pdf
/// Simply put, the corpus keeps track of which paths have been found, and prioritizes seeds
/// whose path has been hit less than average. Ideally, this allows the fuzzer to prioritize
/// less explored coverage.
/// In the paper, a number of iterations is assigned to each sample, and each sample is then
/// scheduled that number of times. This implementation finds 1 / desiredSelectionProportion
/// of the least hit edges, and schedules those. After those have been mutated and evalutated,
/// the list is regenerated.
/// TODO:
/// - In order to properly implement the paper, the number of executions of each sample needs
///     to be scaled by its execution time (e.g. multiple by timeout / execution time), to
///     prioritize faster samples
