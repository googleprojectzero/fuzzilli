# Javascript code

We want to use these JS snippets when creating programs which collect runtime types.
To make them avaibale to the Lifter, we need to save them as strings in swift files.
These files will be included in Swift package.
To do so run:

    ./generateSwift.sh

However this is not optimal nor nice. Refactor me if you can.
